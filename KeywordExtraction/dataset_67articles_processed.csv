Biology student has been denounced for crossing a weed plant with strawberries,https://thereisnews.com/biology-student-has-been-denounced-by-cross-a-marijuana-plant-with-strawberries3333/,"A 24-year-old student in the Faculty of Biology in University of Miami has been brought to the authorities after exhibiting a crossbreeding of two plant species between strawberry and marijuana in his practical class. He has been fanatic of this plant for a long time. Also he says he hasnâ€™t consumed any kind of marijuana â€œIâ€™ve never smoked, nor one puff, I just think itâ€™d be cool to create this crossbreeding of species, just like there are flavored tobacco products I think it would be a good idea to combine strawberry flavor with marijuanaâ€. The teacher was very surprised so he came immediately to the principalâ€™s office. In view of the situation, they decided to report to the authorities, so as not to jeopardize their image. The police have taken the plant, but it was not easy, many students were trying to take it â€œSome of my classmate gone crazy; they wanted to cut some leaves and make a joints. But police came too soon, just I hope justice can be merciful, Iâ€™m not a junkie, just I am a student and I have been trying to play God.

Biology Student Gets Expelled For Crossing A Weed Plant With Strawberries,https://stoptheworld.net/biology-student-gets-expelled-for-crossing-a-weed-plant-with-strawberries/,"A 20 year old student of biology was arrested yesterday for crossing a potent Indica strain of marijuana with Ozark Beauty strawberries. The unusual cross of weed and fruit was discovered by Professor Green at the University of Tampa. Speaking to CNN of the discovery, Green said: I came into class early to prepare for the lesson and i noticed a small row of stout little plants lined up on the window sill with what appeared to be strawberries growing on them. On closer inspection i realised that they were indeed a mix of marijuana and strawberries. I was shocked because we have a strong policy against drugs at this University. Apparently students found Mr Green asleep at his desk when they came into class, upon waking him one student heard the professor laughing uncontrollably and warning them not to eat the strawberries. 20 year old Jack MeHoff told CNN: Iâ€™m not a drug dealer or a heavy user of marijuana, i just thought it would be interesting to try and cross polinate the two plants and it worked. The weed has a strong taste of strawberry and the strawberries taste like a mix of weed with the sweetness of the berries. Jack has since been released from custody on community service and has vowed to stay away from weed for the duration of his remaining time at University. University President Phil McAvity said that they have a tight policy against any drugs and encouraged students to avoid using any mind altering substance. He said: The growing of cannabis or the use of any drug is strictly forbidden at The University Of Tampa. We are proud of the results of students here, the use of drugs impairs the learning experience. Apparently Mr HeHoff has been inundated with enquiries from fellow students about seeds, cuttings and the price of a punnet or container of strawberries. Letâ€™s hope the Uni doesnâ€™t start banning fruit!","[""strawberri"",""student"",""univers"",""drug"",""weed"",""marijuana"",""the university of tampa"",""green"",""tampa"",""plant"",""fruit"",""class"",""year"",""mix"",""cnn"",""us"",""jack mehoff"",""phil mcav"",""hehoff"",""ozark beauti"",""university president phil mcav"",""ozark beauty strawberri"",""potent indica strain"",""community servic"",""uni doesnt start"",""professor green"",""closer inspect"",""strong polici"",""unusual cross"",""tight polici"",]","[""strawberries"",""university"",""weed"",""marijuana"",""students"",""drugs"",""the university of tampa"",""green"",""student"",""plants"",""tampa"",""fruit"",""class"",""year"",""use"",""mix"",""cnn"",""phil mcavity"",""jack mehoff"",""hehoff"",""ozark beauty"",""university president phil mcavity"",""ozark beauty strawberries"",""potent indica strain"",""closer inspection"",""community service"",""uni doesnt start"",""fellow students"",""professor green"",""strong policy"",]"

"Melania Trump's Hotel Charges Were $174,000 For A Day Trip To Toronto: Records",https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/melania-trump-toronto-trip-spending_n_5bef52a4e4b0f32bd589a8d2,"First lady Melania Trumpâ€™s hotel bills for a day trip to Toronto last year added up to an astonishing $174,000, according to federal expense documents reported by Quartz. She did not spend the night. The startling expenditures dwarfed the $95,000 cost of Trumpâ€™s stop at the InterContinental Cairo Semiramis, where she stayed for less than half a day at the end of her tour of Africa last month. Trumpâ€™s spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham implied in an email to Quartz that the first ladyâ€™s â€œadvance teamâ€ was responsible for some of the costs. The team ensures â€œsafety measures, medical care, communications, motorcade needs and logistics are all in place,â€ she wrote. Theyâ€™re all â€œlegally required for official travel,â€ she added. But federal expense documents reported separate, additional costs for the advance team that added up to $18,000, according to Quartz. The hotels are not identified in the expenses. Theyâ€™re listed simply as â€œhotel roomsâ€ under a heading of â€œmiscellaneous foreign awardeesâ€ in the federal expense documents. There are six hotel charges ranging from nearly $12,000 to nearly $49,000, but the documents donâ€™t offer details. (Other charges were for $16,000, $19,000, $35,000 and $43,000.) The first lady was in Toronto to help kick off the Invictus Games, which Britainâ€™s Prince Harry started in 2014 for disabled vet athletes. A pool press report covering the Sept. 23 trip referred to stops that day at the Sheraton, the Ritz Carlton, a return to the Sheraton, and a get-together in the evening with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to watch the opening ceremony of the games at the Air Canada Center. The first ladyâ€™s hotel stops included a 20-minute meeting with Prince Harry (at the Sheraton), and a reception later with 100 competing U.S. athletes, also at the Sheraton, where she gave a short speech, according to the pool report. Trumpâ€™s visits began just after noon and she returned just after midnight to Andrews Air Force Base. President Donald Trump was spending the weekend at his golf club in New Jersey. Grisham was infuriated by news reports about the bill from Melania Trumpâ€™s Cairo visit earlier this month, slamming â€œirresponsibleâ€ journalism after some initial reports said the first lady had spent the night. Grisham noted that Trump had, in fact, only spent some six hours in the hotel. The first ladyâ€™s trip to Toronto also incurred $21,000 in transportation costs, Quartz reported.","[""sheraton"",""quartz"",""toronto"",""federal expense docu"",""grisham"",""trump"",""first ladi"",""hotel"",""month"",""cost"",""dai"",""night"",""new jersei"",""africa"",""stephanie grisham"",""justin trudeau"",""melania trump"",""donald trump"",""ritz carlton"",""harri"",""u. s."",""intercontinental cairo semirami"",""andrews air force bas"",""melania trumps cairo"",""air canada cent"",""earlier this month"",""sept. 23"",""2014"",""canadian prime minister justin trudeau"",""trumps spokeswoman stephanie grisham"",]","[""sheraton"",""quartz"",""toronto"",""federal expense documents"",""grisham"",""first lady"",""month"",""day"",""night"",""new jersey"",""africa"",""stephanie grisham"",""melania trumps"",""justin trudeau"",""donald trump"",""ritz carlton"",""harry"",""u. s."",""intercontinental cairo semiramis"",""andrews air force base"",""melania trumps cairo"",""air canada center"",""trump"",""earlier this month"",""sept. 23"",""2014"",""canadian prime minister justin trudeau"",""first lady melania trumps hotel bills"",""trumps spokeswoman stephanie grisham"",""melania trumps cairo visit"",]"
"Melania Trump's hotel bill for a one-day trip to Canada cost $174,000",https://www.insider.com/melania-trump-hotel-bill-toronto-canada-174000-2018-11,"Melania Trump spent $174,000 on hotels she didn't sleep in on a 12-hour trip to Canada. The hotel bills don't include her staff or logistics team, who had $18,000 total in hotel costs. A one-day trip to Canada by First Lady Melania Trump cost US taxpayers $174,000, according to government spending documents reviewed by Quartz. On September 23, 2017, Trump took a 12-hour trip to visit the Invictus Games, which took place a short drive away from Toronto. There, she met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as well as Prince Harry. She stopped by two hotels at the time: the Ritz Carlton and Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel. Read more: Melania Trump spent $95,000 on a hotel during a one-day visit to Cairo, and she didn't even sleep there. Stephanie Grisham, Trump's spokeswoman, said the $174,000 bill was normal, and that it accounted for a variety of other costs. ""What I can tell you is that when the President or First Lady travels, there are people who travel ahead on the advance team to ensure safety measures, medical care, communications, motorcade needs and logistics are all in place,"" she told Quartz. ""Mrs. Trump travels with a much smaller contingent of staff than that of her predecessors, but the entities I mentioned above are legally required for all official travel."" Melania Trump greeting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Washington. AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais But Grisham's statement is misleading, according to Quartz. The $174,000 cost covered only Trump herself. The costs for her advance team â€” who takes care of the logistics and transportation issues â€” was calculated separately. Their hotel bills were $18,000 in total, with additional costs for transportation. It's not clear how Trump spent that much money. The total is drastically above the highest possible rate for a room at each hotel, and Trump didnt stay overnight at either of them in any case. Her Toronto hotel bills were separated into six different charges, labeled as ""miscellaneous foreign awardees"" in spending records. Trump's hotel spending habits have been questioned before. During a one-day visit to Cairo earlier this year, she racked up $95,000 in hotel bills. She also didn't stay the night.","[""trump"",""hotel"",""$174,000"",""melania trump"",""quartz"",""hotel bil"",""toronto"",""canada"",""cairo"",""justin trudeau"",""canadian prime minister justin trudeau"",""one-day visit"",""12-hour trip"",""advance team"",""logist"",""total"",""place"",""staff"",""cost"",""$95,000"",""$18,000"",""washington"",""stephanie grisham"",""martinez monsivai"",""ritz carlton"",""grisham"",""sheraton centre toronto hotel"",""first lady melania trump"",""september 23, 2017"",""ap photo/pablo martinez monsivai"",]","[""trump"",""$174,000"",""melania trump"",""quartz"",""hotel bills"",""toronto"",""canada"",""cairo"",""justin trudeau"",""canadian prime minister justin trudeau"",""one-day visit"",""12-hour trip"",""advance team"",""logistics"",""hotels"",""total"",""hotel"",""place"",""staff"",""$95,000"",""$18,000"",""washington"",""martinez monsivais"",""stephanie grisham"",""ritz carlton"",""grisham"",""sheraton centre toronto hotel"",""first lady melania trump"",""september 23, 2017"",""ap photo/pablo martinez monsivais"",]"
"Melania Trump's One-Day Toronto Trip Cost $174,000 In Hotel Bills",https://www.glamour.com/story/melania-trump-174000-hotel-bill-toronto,"Melania Trump's travel costs are once again making headlines. Her October trip to Africa included a $95,050 bill from a Cairo hotel where she didn't even spend the night. And now another short trip is coming under scrutiny. While most of us may remember the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto as the first time Meghan Markle and Prince Harry officially appeared in public together as a couple, it was also the first time Mrs. Trump and the British royal met. The First Lady was on hand to lead the U.S. delegation at the annual event for wounded veterans and also took a meeting with Harry. Government records obtained by Quartz show that the First Lady's hotel bill totaled approximately $174,000 of taxpayer money. According to Quartz, the total does not include costs for her advance team ($18,000) or any transportation costs ($21,000). The First Lady's itinerary for the Canadian trip shows her arriving in Toronto close to noon and back in Washington, D.C., around midnight, meaning she did not spend the night at the hotel in question. ""What I can tell you is that when the President or First Lady travels, there are people who travel ahead on the advance team to ensure safety measures, medical care, communications, motorcade needs and logistics are all in place,"" said Mrs. Trump's spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham when asked about specific expenses by Quartz. ""Mrs. Trump travels with a much smaller contingent of staff than that of her predecessors, but the entities I mentioned above are legally required for all official travel."" Maybe there's a more complicated explanation for the hefty bill, but we're quite sure that every trip FLOTUS takes going forward will be analyzed closely.

Hundreds Of Birds Dead During 5G Experiment In Netherlands,https://www.captain-planet.net/hundreds-of-birds-dead-during-5g-experiment-in-netherlands/,"About a week ago at The Hague, many birds died spontaneously, falling dead in a park. You likely havenâ€™t heard a lot about this because it seems keeping it quiet was the plan all along. However, when about 150 more suddenly died â€” bringing the death toll to 297 â€” some started to take notice. And if you are looking around that park you might have seen what is on the corner of the roof across the street from where they died: a new 5G mast, where they had done a test, in connection with the Dutch railway station, to see how large the range was and whether no harmful equipment would occur on and around the station. And harm happened, indeed. Immediately afterward, birds fell dead from the trees. And the nearby ducks that were swimming seemed to react very oddly as well; they were simultaneously putting their heads underwater to escape the radiation while others flew away, landing on the street or in the canal. Again, almost at the exact same time that those animals died, near the station, Holland Spoor was tested with a 5G transmitter mast. â€œIf they all got heart-failure with an healthy body, no signs of any virus, no bacterial infection, healthy blood, no poisons found etc. etc. The only reasonable explanation is, that it is from the new 5G Microwaves having an huge effect of all birds hearts! â€¦ It heavily resonates with certain ERRATIC PULSED Microwaves (millions per second!) which can be proven to have biological effects on organs! â€¦ Am not kidding here! â€¦ â€œSome people assume Microwaves at lower wattage â€œcan not harmâ€ because â€œit does not cook youâ€ â€¦ that very flawed â€œlogicâ€ is what they want you to repeat over and over! â€¦ Search in â€œGoogle Scholar Search Siteâ€: Biological Effects of Non-ionizing Microwaves and be ready to be shocked how stupid most sheeple really are in believing blindly the so called â€œexpertsâ€ & â€ authoritiesâ€ of FCC, Telecom & Wireless Industry propaganda!â€ â€” John Kuhles, founder of Fb.com/groups/Stop5G & Fb.me/Stop5Gowner of Stop5G.net This wasnâ€™t proof though. It was initially just conjecture. All the information that follows comes from John Kuhlesâ€™ public Facebook page (not being a native English speaker, I have cleaned a little of it up but mostly left it intact for you): In the meantime (30-10-2018) received some more information. The birds that fell massively dead would be the victims of an experiment, performed on those days in The Hague, where RF radiation was tested with a peak frequency of 7.40 GHz. This information comes from one source and should still be confirmed, if possible. It is not clear at this moment whether tests with 5G transmission masts have been carried out again, but so far everything points in the direction of 5G as the most probable cause. Earlier, crazy things happened, such as with cows in Groningenâ€™s Loppersum last year, where it was also tested with 5G. But also how in Switzerland a complete herd of cows collapsed in a ravine when there was tested with 5G. Source 1: MSN.com Oct. 26, 2018 In the Huijgenspark in The Hague, more than a hundred starlings have fallen dead from the trees in recent days. It is a mystery what happened to the animals. The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) is having a number of birds examined in the laboratory of Wageningen Bioveterinary Research. Parts of the park are blocked and dogs are no longer allowed to be let out. The dead birds are always cleaned up as quickly as possible. Yet it is a lugubrious scene. Council member Robert Barker of the Party for the Animals had the feeling of being on a â€˜crime sceneâ€™. â€œThe fact that so many birds fall from the sky at this location must have a cause and must be investigated. If there is talk of poisoning, then we have to take a hard time. â€ It is also possible that the birds have a disease. â€œIn any case, itâ€™s going fast. The animals are not emaciated, do not seem ill. They just fall dead from the tree, â€œsays employee Sharon Lexmond of bird shelter De Wulp. A possible link was established between 5G trials in Groningen and the â€˜crazy cows there, as they were called, see: Stopumts.nl Further info from Facebook: Trondheim (3rd city of Norway) also attacked the birds. After 6 months there was no toxicological report yet. It has also happened in Sweden, Australia, United States. Nyhetsspeilet.no In the meantime (30-10-2018) received some more information. The birds that fell massively dead would be the victims of an experiment, performed on those days in The Hague, where RF radiation was tested with a peak frequency of 7.40 GHz, which corresponds to a wavelength of 4.05 cm. This wavelength is of the same order of magnitude as the size of the starlings. This may be important because of possible resonance effects. The mast in question is about 400 meters from where the starlings have fallen dead. This information comes from one source and should still be confirmed, if possible. Source 2: https://www.rtlnieuws.nl Mysterious bird deaths in The Hague: dead starlings fall massively from the sky Oct. 26, 2018 For several days in a row, dead starlings fall from the sky in the Huijgenspark in The Hague. It is estimated that around 150 birds have already lost their lives. What is the cause of this is being investigated? The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, the Dutch Wildlife Health Center and a Wageningen University laboratory are investigating the cause of death of the starlings. A veterinarian of bird care De Wulp performed a number of birds last week. She only found internal bleeding and no trace of poison. Contaminated waterâ€¦ â€Last year we had the same situation at the Haagse Hogeschool, where it was renovated at the time â€, says an employee of the Animal Ambulance.â€ Then dozens of dead jackdaws were found, which were probably poisoned because they had been drinking polluted water. What is going on right now is really speculating. Hopefully, we know more next week, because this is not normal. â€ No trace of poison. Source 3: Dierenhospitaal and Dierenambulance The Hague Again, dead starlings have been found in the Huijgenspark in The Hague. More than ninety dead birds were spread across the park in the Stationsbuurt. We took the birds. Last time, five of the deceased starlings were examined by a local specialist. It did not show signs of poison, but only internal bleeding in two copies. The newly found starlings are examined by the specialized Wageningen Bioveterinary Research laboratory in Lelystad and the Dutch Wildlife Health Center in Utrecht. The municipality has promulgated a ban on dogs in the area because the cause of the mortality is unclear. Poisoning is taken into account. The area has been blocked by the police. Source 4: Birdcare the curlew Oct. 26, 2018 How is the current state of affairs with regard to the dead starlings? Last Friday, Wednesday and Thursday, a total of +/- 150 deceased starlings were found in the Huijgenspark in The Hague. OnSundayy, Thursday and Friday our veterinarian visited and carried out a total of 15 animals and collected material for further research. On Wednesday, the NVWA collected a cargo of birds that were examined in Lelystad on West Nile Virus. The negative result has now arrived. On Thursday, the Dutch Wildlife Health Center also picked up a load of birds and we got a result today. Both veterinarians (ours and those from the DWHC) discussed their findings with each other. (Birds in good condition, some small bleeding in some animals, good for the upcoming winter, empty stomachs.) It is a very strange story! Components of the deceased birds now go to various institutes for further research into rat poison and various viruses. On Monday the preparations are ready and the microscopic examination is started. In the meantime, the municipality has instituted an outlet ban in the park until further notice. We will keep you informed and hope that we will get a quick answer regarding the bizarre deaths. Source 5: New contribution from Facebook: Nov. 2, 2018 There is, of course, no certainty about the cause. There are stronger 4G and IoT channels in the vicinity near the park. In July there was also 5G tested, but then the birds did not swarm and they did not arrive in the park. IoT has also been active since 30 October 2017, so it is only briefly active with a safe distance (for humans) of 7.4 meters and with a 2000 Watt transmitter at less than 200 meters from the park main beam direction exactly across the park. Also at the same distance LTE channels and at another location also LTE stations etc. Here again exactly about the park. The truth about the safety of 5G is that itâ€™s not safe. And while letters have been sent and people have raised the alarm, the â€œpowers that beâ€ donâ€™t seem to care. All in the name of money and industry.

Are 5G Experiments Killing Birds: Is This A Conspiracy?,http://www.roamingbuzz.com/are-5g-experiments-killing-birds-is-this-a-conspiracy/,"Technology is on a never-ending cycle where it becomes more and more advanced with each day that passes. Itâ€™s surreal to see how far technology has come over the past couple of years. Wireless technology has been one of the major drivers in todayâ€™s technological advancements and economic development. In 2010 Sprint released the first WiMAX smartphone in the US, the HTC Evo 4G. This allowed people to experience faster and more efficient internet speeds. But like all things nowadays, something newer and better is around the corner. The fifth generation of wireless technology that is referred to as 5G, is on its way. In fact, Verizon has begun to activate its new home internet service that runs atop its 5G wireless network. They call it 5G Home and is being used in Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and Sacramento â€“ with speeds reaching 300 Mbps! As the 5G network develops, the next generation wireless network has got the ability to create extended economic opportunities for millions of people, increase growth, and allow other technologies to develop along the way like smart appliances on the IoT, autonomous vehicles, robotics and automation, better entertainment services, and incredible internet speeds. . However, while all this sounds outstanding, not everyone is on board, yet. There is a number of reasons for this, but they mainly relate to health concerns. While 5G network would allow super speed downloads, this would require cell phone towers to be located closer to homes/offices than before. In the U.S. it is said that they are going to install around 300,000 new towers. This is causing outrage amongst local neighborhoods due to the high-frequency waves that support the faster speeds. Locals say locating the towers so close to their homes is a serious health concern and could even cause cancer due to the high level of electromagnetic radiation. Why is There Controversy Surrounding a 5G Network? Speculation about 5G towers being located next to domestic areas has been going around since 2017. An event that occurred in The Netherlands has sparked some outrage and more worries and concerns. In October 2018, hundreds of birds in a park in the Netherlands suddenly started falling from the trees and dying during a suspected 5G experiment around The Hague. It was also reported that nearby ducks that were swimming began to react oddly, concurrently putting their heads underwater in what is believed to be, escape of the radiation, while other flew away. While there is no concrete evidence that suggests a direct link to the death of the birds to the experiment that was taking place, others are convinced that the spontaneous death of hundreds of birds was not just a coincidence. Between the 19th of October and the 3rd of November 2018, 339 dead birds were found. The municipality is unable to rule out their deaths being a result of poisoning however, there was a dog ban ordered around the park. The Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority confirmed that viruses like West Nile and Usutu were not the cause of death and have not ruled out any other viruses or poisoning as of 12th November 2018. A team of experts is investigating the cause of deaths and the incident links. While others claim that the reason for the deaths is related to the experiment that was taking place, others say it was just a freak accident. The Netherlands is not the first place such an event has occurred. In fact, back in 2011 in Arkansas, Louisiana, and certain areas of Sweden, it was reported that thousands of birds mysteriously and almost simultaneously died. It was reported by the Associated Press that these mass bird deaths are quite common and unexplained. Is the 5G experiment to blame? 5G network developers promise faster data rates in addition to reduced energy and financial cost. These developments will arise from the use of higher frequency radio bands and the development of more advanced cellular towers. When new wireless technologies such as 5G come about, they are assigned higher radio frequencies. This is due to the fact that the tech needs higher frequencies as it is typically not used and move data at much faster speeds. The issue is that higher frequencies signals do not travel as far as lower frequencies so more signal towers or MIMOs will have to be installed anywhere 5G is offered. In Europe, 5G will make use of three frequency ranges: a low-frequency 700MHz â€œcoverage layerâ€, a 3.4-3.8GHz band which will be the primary bandwidth and a â€œsuper data layerâ€ in the highest frequency 24.25-27.5GHz band. However, it is important to note that these are theoretical ranges and were not the ranges tested in The Netherlands. Nevertheless, all these frequencies are considered to be safe according to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. The radio waves that are used in cellular technology can be described both by their frequency and in terms of the energy being used to carry that frequency. Dr. Eric van Rongen, member of HCN and the chairman of ICNIRP stated that the levels of exposure in the 5G frequency range are similar and can be compared to the levels of exposure in the current 3G and 4G networks, and thus, much lower than the exposure limits. He also stated that the only way one could imagine the death of the birds being related to the experiment is if there were very high exposure levels that result in considerable heating. However, the levels that were being used for the experiment were not strong enough for that to happen. So whatâ€™s the verdict? The truth is, no one really knows what caused the death of the birds. We can only assume and speculate until there is a hard proof that confirms that the 5G network experiments are to blame. Until then, people will continue to come up with all sorts of claims and conspiracies. 5G has the power to take technology to the next level, further modernizing our generation by providing greatly enhanced speed, coverage, and responsiveness of wireless networks. And just like many of the modern advancements in the fields of technology and innovation, there will be resistance and there will be protests against the development by people inside and outside the industry. However, as things progress and tests return results in favor of the technology, evidence will reflect the impact on health and radiation exposure. The long-term effects will require more observation and to be determined in the future. At this point in time, it is recommended to stay vigilant and have a healthy dose of skepticism. It is recommended that we do not jump into conclusions without evidence and not to indulge in propagating unverified claims and conspiracies, especially if such claims are spread around by individuals who have limited understanding of the subject matter and have no experience in the industry, academically and experimentally.

Unexplained Mass Bird Deaths During Dutch 5G Experiment,https://consciouslifenews.com/unexplained-mass-bird-deaths-during-dutch-5g-experiment/11162674/#,"By Erin Elizabeth | Principia Scientifica Editor's Note: While we mostly ever hear the alleged good news about 5G, and about how its infrastructures continues to be put in place, some health practitioners and others have stated substantial concerns about its safety to human beings, as well as to the flora and fauna around us. You may find the following article to be disturbing, and beg the question, â€œAt what price progress?â€ Or you may ask if the birds discussed in the following article are the proverbial â€œcanaries in the coalmine?â€ Please let us know what you think of this story in our comments section below. Unexplained Mass Bird Deaths During Dutch 5G Experiment. About a week ago at The Hague, many birds died spontaneously, falling dead in a park. You likely havenâ€™t heard a lot about this because it is being kept quiet. However, when about 150 more suddenly died â€“ bringing the death toll to 297 â€“ people started to notice. And if you are looking around that park you see what stands on the corner of the roof across the street from where they died: a new 5G mast, where they had done a test, in connection with the Dutch railway station, to see how large the range was and what environmental impact would occur on and around the station. And harm sure did happen. Immediately the test began birds started to fall dead from the trees. And the nearby ducks that were swimming seemed to react very oddly as well; they were simultaneously putting their heads underwater to escape the radiation while others flew away, landing on the street or in the canal. Talk about coincidences. At the exact same time that those animals died, near the station, the new Holland Spoor 5G transmitter mast was being tested. â€œIf they all got heart-failure despite having healthy bodies, no signs of any virus, no bacterial infection, healthy blood, no poisons found etc. etc then the only reasonable explanation is that it is from the new 5G Microwaves interfering with all the birds hearts! â€¦ The 5G mast heavily resonates with certain ERRATIC PULSED Microwaves (millions per second!) which can be proven to have biological effects on organs! â€¦ We are not kidding here! â€¦ Some people assume Microwaves at lower wattage â€œcan not harmâ€ because â€œit does not cook youâ€ â€¦ that very flawed â€œlogicâ€ is what they want you to repeat over and over! â€¦ Search in â€œGoogle Scholar Search Siteâ€: Biological Effects of Non-ionizing Microwaves and be ready to be shocked how stupid most sheeple really are in believing blindly the so called â€œexpertsâ€ & â€ authoritiesâ€ of FCC, Telecom & Wireless Industry propaganda!â€ -John Kuhles, founder of Fb.com/groups/Stop5G & Fb.me/Stop5G owner of Stop5G.net For the Authorities this wasnâ€™t proof though. It was conjecture. All the information that follows comes from John Kuhlesâ€™ public Facebook page (not being a native English speaker, I have cleaned a little of it up but mostly left it intact for you): In the meantime (October 30, 2018) we received some more information. The vast number of dead birds are the victims of an experiment, performed then at The Hague, where RF radiation was tested with a peak frequency of 7.40 GHz. This information comes from one source and needs further confirmation, if possible. It is not clear at this moment whether tests with 5G transmission masts have been carried out again, but so far everything points in the direction of 5G as the most probable cause. Earlier, crazy things happened, such as with cows in Groningenâ€™s Loppersum last year, where it was also tested with 5G. But also how in Switzerland a complete herd of cows collapsed in a ravine where there was also 5G testing.

Elon Musk joins #DeleteFacebook effort as Tesla and SpaceX pages vanish,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/23/elon-musk-delete-facebook-spacex-tesla-mark-zuckerberg,"In a jab against the embattled social network, Musk joked â€˜Whatâ€™s Facebook?â€™ before deactivating his companiesâ€™ official pages This article is more than 2 years old This article is more than 2 years old Elon Musk joined the #DeleteFacebook movement on Friday, taking down official pages for two of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, after he learned â€“ apparently for the first time â€“ that the pages existed. The billionaire chief executive engaged in some light-hearted Twitter trolling on Friday morning, responding to a tweet from the WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, which urged people to delete the social network with the query: â€œWhatâ€™s Facebook?â€ Elon Musk (@elonmusk) Whatâ€™s Facebook? When a Twitter user brought up the fact that SpaceX has a profile on the massive social media platform and asked whether he would put his money where his mouth was, Musk responded: â€œI didnâ€™t realize there was one. Will do.â€ Musk also said that he had â€œliterally never seen it even onceâ€, presumably breaking the heart of the social media staffer whose job it was to create and manage the page in the first place. Minutes later, both the Facebook pages of both Tesla and SpaceX had been deactivated. A Tesla spokesperson declined to comment on the motivation. Steve Bannon on Cambridge Analytica: 'Facebook data is for sale all over the world' Read more Facebook has faced an onslaught of criticism from elected officials, former employees, the press and its own users in the wake of the Observerâ€™s reporting that personal information about 50 million US Facebook users was harvested largely without usersâ€™ knowledge or consent and then improperly given to the political consultancy company Cambridge Analytica. But Musk has long had a touchy relationship with Facebookâ€™s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. In 2016, Zuckerberg was a touch less than gracious about the accidental explosion of a SpaceX rocket carrying a satellite intended for use on his Internet.org project. â€œIâ€™m deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceXâ€™s launch failure destroyed our satellite,â€ he wrote at the time. Musk also addressed that brouhaha, responding to a reporterâ€™s tweet about the incident: â€œYeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance.â€ Elon Musk (@elonmusk) Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance. The rival billionaires have also traded barbs over artificial intelligence. Musk has long pushed for regulation of AI, warning that the technology poses a â€œfundamental risk to the existence of civilizationâ€. In July 2017, Zuckerberg addressed Muskâ€™s views in a Facebook Live broadcast, stating that focusing on â€œdoomsday scenariosâ€ was â€œreally negativeâ€ and â€œpretty irresponsibleâ€. Musk shot back in a tweet, saying: â€œIâ€™ve talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.â€ Still, Muskâ€™s commitment to deleting Facebook does not appear to extend to Instagram, the photo sharing service owned by Facebook where the billionaire frequently shares selfies and snapshots of his travels, cars, and rockets. Asked about his continued use of Instagram, Musk tweeted: â€œItâ€™s borderline.

Elon Musk Offers To Buy And Then Delete Facebook,https://alternative-science.com/elon-musk-facebook/,"Earlier this week, Elon Musk made global headlines when he deleted the official SpaceX and Tesla pages from Facebook. Musk made certain to clarify that he didnâ€™t make the decision for political reasons, but rather because Facebook gives him â€œthe willies.â€ Itâ€™s not a political statement and I didnâ€™t do this because someone dared me to do it. Just donâ€™t like Facebook. Gives me the willies. Sorry. â€” Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2018 Today, Musk announced that he has reached out to Facebook and offered to buy every share of the company, effectively making him the sole owner of the social media platform. Musk was speaking to a gathering of SpaceX and Tesla investors and told the group even though he has deep misgivings about the site, heâ€™d â€œdo humanity a favorâ€ and buy it. â€œIâ€™ve got some cash to burn, so if Zuck wants to make a deal, he knows where to find me,â€ Musk told investors. â€œIâ€™d make him a fair offer.â€ Musk then showed a PowerPoint presentation that detailed in great length what his plan for Facebook would be. â€œYou know, when I told some close confidantes about this idea of mine, they all wanted to know what Iâ€™d do with Facebook,â€ Musk explained. â€œAnd as much as I know people like to use it as the Internetâ€™s premier ex-girlfriend or boyfriend stalking platform, I think I have much better solution, and I mean better for the species, if not our entire planet.â€ Musk showed the investors in the room an animated video that detailed his plans for Facebook. The video shows a SpaceX Falcon rocket blasting off into the sky. At one point the two solid boosters fall off and glide on a precise path down to the landing pad. Both rockets land perfectly square, and one ends up resting gently on a big red button labeled â€œDELETE.â€ â€œAnd you can see that the second side booster would end up pressing the delete button,â€ Musk said. â€œWhich would send a proton torpedo down the exhaust port of Facebookâ€™s headquarters, triggering a chain reaction that should destroy the platform.â€ Cheers erupted in the room. Chants of â€œFuck Zuck! Fuck Zuck! Fuck Zuck!â€ reverberated throughout the building, growing so loud it drowned out the sound of the oceanâ€™s waves at every beach on the planet. Musk stepped away from the podium he was speaking from, raised his arms in the air in triumph, and took in the adulation from everyone in the room. This story is developing.

"In a tweet storm, Elon Musk says heâ€™s deleting Tesla and SpaceX Facebook accounts",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/23/elon-musk-tweets-he-will-delete-tesla-and-spacex-facebook-accounts.html,"As of Friday at 1 p.m. EST, both the SpaceX and Tesla Facebooks were unreachable. Elon Musk took to Twitter Friday with a series of tweets throwing shade at Facebook, saying he would delete both the SpaceX and Tesla pages on the social media platform. ""I'll just refer you to Elon's tweets this morning,"" a Tesla spokesperson said in an email to CNBC Make It. SpaceX declined to comment. The tweet storm started with Musk, CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, making fun of home-speaker maker Sonos for pulling its ads from Facebook and Instagram for a week. Then Musk went on to respond to WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton's tweet asking users to delete Facebook, a call to action that has been circulating in the wake of the turmoil of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Another user responded to the chain, suggesting Facebook was a ""place for dumb people who believes Mark [Zuckerberg] and submit their personal data so that it can be harvested."" Musk responded with a seemingly sarcastic affirmation. Musk went on to say he did not know there was a SpaceX Facebook page and would delete it. When another Twitter user expressed disbelief, Musk doubled down. Another Twitter user asked Musk whether he thought the Tesla Facebook page should be deleted, too. And again, Musk responded in the affirmative. Musk says he has never used Facebook. He is, however, fairly active on Instagram and didn't indicate any problem with the photo-first social media platform. (Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012.) Though Tesla and SpaceX, prior to Friday, maintained Facebook pages, the companies did not pay to advertise on the social media giant, says Musk.

WHAT HAPPENS TO DRUG SNIFFING DOGS IF ILLINOIS LEGALIZES MARIJUANA,https://967theeagle.net/what-happens-to-drug-sniffing-dogs-if-illinois-legalizes-marijuana/,"A lot of resources have been used to train police dogs how to detect pot but new laws can change everything. I was driving through Rockford the other day and there was a car pulled over by a police officer. I couldn't help but wonder what was going on. Was the driver speeding? Then I noticed there was a K-9 unit checking out the vehicle. Immediately, I knew they were looking for drugs. The state of Illinois has spent thousands of dollars and hours to train drug-sniffing dogs to find marijuana. What happens to these dogs if weed is legalized in Illinois? According to pantagraph.com, ""If pot use becomes legal, the dogs would likely either have to be retrained which some handlers say is impossible or impractical or retired. The biggest thing for law enforcement is, you're going to have to replace all of your dogs.â€ What have they done in other states that have legalized marijuana? ""Some states have either attempted to retrain their animals to ignore pot or, for new police dogs, taught them to smell all narcotics other than cannabis. In other states, agencies have kept their pot-sniffing dogs and continued to search for large amounts of the drug not allowed under the law."" Experts don't believe the dogs can be retrained and that it will set back the whole K-9 program in Illinois.

"If Pot is Legalized in Illinois, What Happens to Medical Marijuana?",https://news.wttw.com/2019/05/23/if-pot-legalized-illinois-what-happens-medical-marijuana,"UPDATE: Illinois Welcomes Weed, Waits on a Budget with Another Extended Session Anyone who figured it would be easy for Democrats to legalize marijuana, think again. Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors Attempts have stalled in New York and New Jersey. The effort is still alive in Illinois, but thereâ€™s only a week or so left before the legislative session is set to adjourn, and negotiations are ongoing. Where does that leave the stateâ€™s blossoming medical marijuana pilot program, which first took effect in 2014 and is set to expire next year? The program was intentionally restrictive â€“ so much so that when pot dispensaries opened their doors in 2015, sales were slow. â€œI think there was a lot of people that didnâ€™t that the program was even going on. I still a lot of people arenâ€™t necessarily informed that itâ€™s going on,â€ said Paul Lee, the general manager of Chicagoâ€™s first cannabis shop, Dispensary 33 in Andersonville. He says things picked up â€“ especially after former Gov. Bruce Rauner last summer signed a law liberalizing the program. It allows doctors to effectively prescribe marijuana as an alternative to addicting opioids, it removed a requirement that potential patients be fingerprinted, and patients can register for provisional access rather than having to wait months for approval. Total retail sales since the programâ€™s inception have now topped $323 million, and as of early May, more than 65,500 patients are certified to participate â€“ nearly double the number of patients on the stateâ€™s registry at this time last year. Dispensary 33 is preparing for the day Illinoisâ€™ market opens up even more â€“ to anyone 21 or older. Lee is hiring more employees, increasing training, even redecorating the store with custom cannabis wallpaper and art made of hand-stained sheets cut to the size of rolling paper. Cannabis cultivation centers, like Cresco Labs, are also expanding in preparation for legal weed. â€œOf course, weâ€™re looking down the road at what it could be. So, this facility here in Joliet, you know, weâ€™ve built out to our full capacity and weâ€™re expanding other facilities around the state to be able to accommodate both the future patient growth and an adult-use program here in this state,â€ Cresco spokesman Jason Erkes said. â€œWe want to be ready for when and if that happens, to be able to accommodate, you know, the patients, the consumers, and anybody thatâ€™s interested in buying cannabis products.â€ While lawmakers continue to debate what legal pot should look like in Illinois, it seems they have settled on this much: Even if it gets to the point that any adult could get legal weed, llinois will continue to have a medical marijuana program. â€œWhy would we keep a medical program, if thereâ€™s a recreational source around and you could skip seeing the doctor and just go get it yourself? Itâ€™s that youâ€™ll miss out on the monitoring with oneâ€™s other medications, for instance,â€ said Dr. Leslie Mendoza Temple, a physician in Glenview who chaired the state governmentâ€™s now-disbanded Medical Marijuana Advisory Board. â€œWe would want to be sure weâ€™re monitoring for abuse, toxicity. And you wouldnâ€™t have those checks in place if one were just using it without kind of any medical supervision, if youâ€™re using it for medical purposes.â€ To be part of the official medical program, a physician needs to certify patients as having one of the 41 debilitating conditions, including AIDS, glaucoma, Parkinsonâ€™s or PTSD. Lawmakers are also set to consider adding more conditions and letting nurses (not just doctors) do the certification, under a plan sponsored by state Rep. Bob Morgan, D-Deerfield, that would also make the medical marijuana program permanent. Patients using pot as medicine have to apply, register with the state and pay the $100 annual fee for a card. Itâ€™s a somewhat rigorous process that requires completing a bunch of paperwork. But patients would get a benefit for their trouble: -The recreational cannabis legislation contemplates tax rates ranging from 10% to 25%, depending on THC levels. Compare that with the 1% sales tax on medical marijuana (the same sales tax for all pharmaceuticals). -The medical cannabis wouldnâ€™t be subject to the same potency limits as recreational pot. -Itâ€™s likely that only medical marijuana patients will be permitted to grow weed at home. The initial proposal backed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker called for allowing anyone over 21 to be able to grow up to five cannabis plants at home. But a forthcoming revised version is expected to scale it back as part of a compromise with law enforcement. Sponsoring Sen. Heather Steans, D-Chicago, told WTTW News itâ€™s an important option for those who use marijuana as medicine, given that insurance and Medicaid wonâ€™t pay for it because the drug is still illegal at the federal level. Steans says growing it at home could be a less-expensive option. But Temple is against recreational marijuana â€“ sheâ€™s concerned about the message it sends to youth, and about potential abuses. Sheâ€™s also concerned about what an expanded market will mean for her patients, who count on the drug to help them sleep, stem nausea or subdue pain. â€œI want to see my patients protected in getting the highest quality products with the high CBD, the low THC, which many of them want and benefit from, and what I donâ€™t know is how the market is going to take over when recreational cannabis takes over. Because then price will become a driver,â€ she said. Even some initial skeptics admit theyâ€™ve warmed to Illinoisâ€™ strict rules governing the medical marijuana program. â€œWeâ€™ve ensured basically that each patient, when they come in and buy one of our products, they know exactly what theyâ€™re getting, they know that it hasnâ€™t been treated with pesticides, they know that itâ€™s good quality, and they know that itâ€™s going to be consistent every time they get it,â€ said John Sullivan of Illinois Grown Medicine, a cultivation center in Elk Grove Village. Like Dispensary 33 and Cresco, Illinois Grown Medicine is growing operations in anticipation of Illinois making weed legal to anyone age 21 or older. Under the proposal lawmakers are set to consider, patients who want to continue buying medical marijuana would get dibs. â€œDispensaries and cultivators will have to set aside products sufficient to meet the demands of patients,â€ said state Rep. Kelly Cassidy, D-Chicago, who is the House sponsor of the recreational cannabis bill. â€œWeâ€™re not going to let folks go without their relief.â€ Follow Amanda Vinicky on Twitter: @AmandaVinicky Related stories: Marijuana is a Psychoactive Drug.

FBI Special Agent David Raynor murdered with his own gun,https://archive.fo/QZkkr#selection-1489.0-1489.56,"FBI Agent, Who Exposed Hillary Clinton's Cover-up, Found Dead FBI Special Agent David Raynor murdered with his own gun | @NeonNettle By: Jay Greenberg on 18th June 2018 @ 2.45pm Â© press Special Agent David Raynor was due to testify against Hillary Clinton when he died An FBI Special Agent, who was anticipated to expose the extent of Clinton and Obama malpractice and corruption in the ""Operation Fast and Furious"" cover-up before a US Federal Grand Jury, has been found dead at his home. The FBI official's wife was also found dead at the scene with the couple both being murdered using the 52-year-old agent's own gun. Raynor's tragic death comes just one day before he was due to testify before a US Federal Grand Jury He was widely expected to testify that Hillary Clinton acted illegally to protect Obama administration crimes while covering up the Fast and Furious scandal. Â© Facebook Special Agent David Raynor and his wife were both found dead Raynorâ€™s wife, Donna Fisher, was also found dead at the scene. An autopsy will be completed to determine the exact cause of death, according to police. According to the Baltimore Sun Authorities, who are offering a $215,000 reward for tips in Suiterâ€™s killing, have struggled to understand what happened. The detective was shot with his own gun, which was found at the scene. Two other shots were fired from the gun, and Davis said there were signs of a brief struggle. Special Agent Raynorâ€™s suspicious death is the latest in a sequence of disturbing deaths in Baltimore connected to the Clinton/Obama cover-up of Operation Fast and Furious. When President Trump took power, the US Justice Department opened another investigation into Operation Fast and Furious as it pertained to the Baltimore Police Department and impaneled a US Federal Grand Jury. Â© Facebook Special Agent David Raynor was due to testify against Hillary Clinton One of the main witnesses was Detective Sean Suiter, an 18-year veteran of the FBI. However, Detective Suiter was gunned down in November, in eerily similar circumstances to Special Agent Raynor , also one day before he could testify. Â© press The couple was found murdered outside their home Special Agent Raynor was leading US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosensteinâ€™s and FBI Director Christopher Wrayâ€™s investigation into the murder of Detective Sean Suiter, who he believed was silenced before he could testify that the Obama administration was criminally complicit in allowing guns to flow into the hands of criminals on the Mexican border. Â© press The was was killed using Special Agent David Raynor's own gun These guns were involved in the murder of a US Federal Officer, among others, and is seen by investigators as the â€œAchilles heel of the Obama regime,â€ because the murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry is one of but a very few Obama administration crimes that have no statute of limitations as it involved the killing of a US Federal Officer. Leaked Wikileaks emails also prove Hillary Clinton was fully knowledgeable about the crime â€”thus making her liable to criminal charges. Â© press Police close off the area around the couple's home where their bodies were found Last's week's bombshell Inspector General's reports have exposed yet more Hillary Clinton and Obama Administration crimes. The report, that was released last Thursday, revealed that the FBI had discovered evidence that Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation had committed "" sexual crimes against children ."" The report also shows that Obama lied to cover-up parts of these investigations that exposed child trafficking. However, the IG report proves that the evidence of these crimes has been covered-up and swept under the carpet by those acting at the highest levels.","[""hillary clinton"",""obama"",""fbi"",""david raynor"",""gun"",""agent david raynor"",""us federal grand juri"",""investig"",""murder"",""scene"",""death"",""oper"",""baltimor"",""sean suit"",""clinton"",""raynor"",""us federal offic"",""obama administration crim"",""special agent raynor"",""detective sean suit"",""facebook"",""own gun"",""report"",""press"",""crime"",""coupl"",""evid"",""home"",""dai"",""christopher wrai"",]","[""hillary clinton"",""obama"",""fbi"",""david raynor"",""agent david raynor"",""us federal grand jury"",""operation"",""murder"",""scene"",""death"",""gun"",""baltimore"",""sean suiter"",""clinton"",""raynor"",""us federal officer"",""obama administration crimes"",""detective sean suiter"",""facebook"",""evidence"",""own gun"",""report"",""couple"",""press"",""guns"",""home"",""day"",""christopher wrays"",""rod rosensteins"",""jay greenberg"",]"
Was an FBI Agent Who Exposed Hillary Clintonâ€™s Corruption Found Dead?,https://anticorruptiondigest.com/2018/07/25/was-an-fbi-agent-who-exposed-hillary-clintons-corruption-found-dead/#axzz5uapEVDmG,"Was an FBI Agent Who Exposed Hillary Clintonâ€™s Corruption Found Dead? On 18 June 2018, the disreputable website Neon Nettle reported that an FBI agent was murdered as part of a conspiracy to cover up the corruption of Hillary Clinton, who unsuccessfully ran for the presidency of the U.S. in 2016: But thereâ€™s no mystery surrounding how Raynor died â€” Anne Arundel County Police Lt. Ryan Frashure told us officers witnessed Raynorâ€™s turning his gun on himself on 7 March 2018: Investigators believe Raynor stabbed his 54-year-old wife, Donna Fisher, to death near their home in Crownsville, Maryland, before killing himself. The couple had been in the midst of divorce proceedings and, Frashure said, were â€œhaving serious domestic issues.â€ The week they died they were in court fighting over custody of their 10-year-old daughter. According to investigators, no evidence suggests Raynorâ€™s death was in any way connected to the Fast and Furious operation, an Obama-era â€œgunwalkingâ€ scandal. Moreover, â€œFast and Furiousâ€ had nothing to do with Hillary Clintonâ€™s State Department, as it involved the Phoenix division of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosivesâ€™ (ATF), an organization within the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). Neon Nettleâ€™s sole documentation for their claim that Raynor died â€œjust one day before he was due to testify before a US Federal Grand Juryâ€ was a link to an eight-month-old news article about the shooting death of a Baltimore homicide detective, an article that made no mention of David Raynor, the FBI, Hillary Clinton, or â€œFast and Furious.â€ (The slain detective was scheduled to testify before a federal grand jury, but that case was about Baltimore police accused of shaking down citizens and conspiring with drug dealers, not about the ATF and gunwalking in Arizona.)

"FBI Official, Who Exposed Clintonâ€™s â€˜Fast & Furiousâ€™ Cover Up, Found Dead",https://newspunch.com/fbi-clinton-fast-furious-dead/,,,
Army Welcomes First Openly Transgender Military Working Dogs,https://www.duffelblog.com/2014/12/army-military-working-dogs/,"JOINT BASE LEWIS-McCHORD, Wash. â€” Meet Tracker, a five-year-old, sixty-pound Belgian Malinois and a graduate of the Military Working Dog School at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. Heâ€™s also one of the Armyâ€™s first five openly transgender military police dogs, assigned to the 42nd Military Police Brigade at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. â€œWe took to each other pretty quickly,â€ said Spc. Jeffrey Grassley, a military policeman and dog handler partnered with Tracker. â€œI mean, itâ€™s a little weird that they tell me to call him a â€˜him,â€™ since heâ€™s obviously a female dog, and there was that time last month when he was laid up for a few days after he gave birth to a litter of puppies, but weâ€™ve really forged a close working friendship.â€ Tracker, who was raised as a female dog under the name Regina, first identified as a male during the initial breeding and selection process the military uses to screen potential military working dogs. â€œLooking back now, it was pretty obvious that she was â€” sorry, He â€” was a little different,â€ said Tech Sgt. Walter Flaherty, one of Trackerâ€™s trainers. â€œHe didnâ€™t really say much, obviously, but you could just sort of tell.â€ During play time, Flaherty said, Tracker would consistently engage in behavior normally associated with male dogs, and whenever he would go into heat, would go after the females pretty aggressively, almost totally ignoring the male dogs. â€œHe would only play with blue chew toys, and for some reason, he really liked watching reruns of â€˜Xena: Warrior Princess,'â€ Flaherty added. Paws Across The Rainbow, the nationâ€™s leading advocacy group for LGBT animals, hailed the move, calling it a â€œlandmark achievement for all military working animals, no matter what their sexuality.â€ â€œWe hope that this will serve as an example throughout the military that being transgendered is simply not a reason to discriminate against competent and talented military working animals of all species, said spokesman Pat Riley, while also calling on the Army to provide no-cost gender-reassignment surgery for the dogs â€œas a gesture of tolerance and recognition of the diverse nature of todayâ€™s military working animals.â€ Some of the more traditional, conservative elements within the Army might not be so ready to embrace such a radical change, however. The all-male caisson horses of the 3rd Infantry Regiment, or â€œThe Old Guard,â€ long entrusted with the solemn honor of bearing the caskets of fallen warriors and deceased U.S. presidents, have drawn fire for refusing to allow female or openly LGBT horses within its ranks, and the regimentâ€™s command team is unapologetic about that fact. â€œAs long as Iâ€™m here, thatâ€™s the way itâ€™s going to stay,â€ said Command Sgt. Maj. Samuel J. Stoker, The Old Guardâ€™s senior noncommissioned officer. â€œIâ€™ll resign before Iâ€™ll see some fancy-prancing fairy-horsey bear my president down the National Mall.â€ Stoker may be the last of a dying breed, however. Polling data suggests that most service members are indifferent to the idea, with 15 percent of those polled say they would â€œdefinitelyâ€ or â€œvery likelyâ€ be willing to work with an openly LGBT military working animal. In that regard, Tracker and his four compatriots are pioneers in more than one way: If all goes well, according to sources within Defense Secretary Chuck Hagelâ€™s office, their service may open the door to full integration for all LGBT military working animals. As for Spc. Grassley, Trackerâ€™s handler, he says he doesnâ€™t concern himself with the larger political implications of Trackerâ€™s assignment to the unit, and just treats him as his K-9 partner, nothing more. â€œEvery once in a while he tries to hump my leg, which is kind of pointless since he doesnâ€™t have a penis, but itâ€™s just a male-dominance thing, and besides, itâ€™s pretty funny.â€","[""anim"",""tracker"",""armi"",""flaherti"",""joint base lewis-mcchord"",""he"",""female dog"",""male dog"",""reason"",""dog"",""ill"",""wai"",""texa"",""wash"",""jeffrey grasslei"",""walter flaherti"",""samuel j. stok"",""chuck hagel"",""pat rilei"",""grasslei"",""regina"",""u. s."",""42nd military police brigad"",""lackland air force bas"",""3rd infantry regi"",""national mal"",""defens"",""defense secretary chuck hagels offic"",""no-cost gender-reassignment surgeri"",""command sgt. maj. samuel j. stok"",]","[""animals"",""tracker"",""flaherty"",""joint base lewis-mcchord"",""army"",""hes"",""female dog"",""male dogs"",""reason"",""dogs"",""ill"",""way"",""texas"",""wash"",""samuel j. stoker"",""jeffrey grassley"",""walter flaherty"",""chuck hagels"",""pat riley"",""grassley"",""regina"",""u. s."",""42nd military police brigade"",""lackland air force base"",""3rd infantry regiment"",""national mall"",""defense"",""defense secretary chuck hagels office"",""no-cost gender-reassignment surgery"",""command sgt. maj. samuel j. stoker"",]"
"Treason? Ilhan Omar Gives Iran Military Advice, Suggests It Could Target Trump Hotels",https://pjmedia.com/trending/treason-ilhan-omar-gives-iran-military-advice-suggests-it-target-trump-hotels/,"The inspiringly patriotic Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Tehran, no, check that, Iâ€™m hearing sheâ€™s from Minnesota) tweeted Monday offering some unsolicited military advice to the Islamic Republic of Iran: â€œTrump needs to immediately divest from his businesses and comply with the emoluments clause. Iran could threaten Trump hotels *worldwide* and he could provoke war over the loss of revenue from skittish guests. His business interests should not be driving military decisions.â€ She also tweeted a video in which the late comedian George Carlin asserts that the U.S. is â€œnot very good at anythingâ€ besides war. And so once again we have to ask the by-now-familiar question: Is Ilhan Omar a traitor who hates America? Omarâ€™s warning that Trumpâ€™s â€œbusiness interests should not be driving military decisionsâ€ makes no sense, because clearly the fact that Trump owns hotels that Iran could target didnâ€™t stop him from going after Qasem Soleimani. But as far as Omar and her ideological allies are concerned, it doesnâ€™t matter how much they have to twist their logic into pretzels to get Trump, as long as they make the president look bad. That imperative has now driven Omar even to give a military suggestion to a hostile foreign power. The mullahs and their henchmen havenâ€™t said anything about targeting Trump hotels, so here is a United States congresswoman to give them a marvelous new idea about how they could murder Americans and others, and further menace the United States. The definition of treason is giving aid and comfort to the enemy. The leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran order their people to chant â€œDeath to Americaâ€ in mosques every Friday, and repeatedly vow that they will ultimately destroy the United States of America and the state of Israel. They were doing this before Soleimani was killed, and theyâ€™re doing it now. How is giving them a suggestion about how they could target the United States, whether or not they have or would have thought of it themselves, not giving aid and comfort to the enemy, and hence treason? When she took the oath of office to become a member of the United States House of Representatives, she swore to â€œsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic,â€ as well as to â€œbear true faith and allegiance to the same.â€ Inviting, out of a hysterical hostility to the president of the United States, a nation that regularly chants â€œDeath to Americaâ€ to strike American-owned businesses â€“ is that supporting and defending the nation against foreign enemies? Omar might well split hairs and assert that she suggested no attack on the Constitution, which is what she specifically swore to defend, but clearly the oath uses â€œConstitutionâ€ as a metonymy for the nation as a whole. Abetting this impression is the fact that Omar on the same day demonstrated her hostility to the country that she has sworn to protect and defend. She tweeted the Carlin video with the comment: â€œItâ€™s no laughing matter,â€ just so weâ€™re clear that she didnâ€™t mean any joke. She is seriously offering the claim that the country to which she has sworn allegiance and which she represents in its Legislative Branch is just a war-mongering blunderer that is not good at anything besides being militarily aggressive. Meanwhile, she invites the military aggression of one of Americaâ€™s foremost enemies. If the Islamic Republic of Iran turns out to be not good at much of anything besides war against the United States, would Ilhan Omar have any problem with that? Despite all this and more, it is, of course, inconceivable that any treason charges will ever be brought against Ilhan Omar. Her hatred of America plays well among the American Leftists who share it, and the Democratic Party establishment would condemn any such charges as a partisan attack and the attacker as a racist right-wing white supremacist and enemy of all that is good. Meanwhile, the past week has given us abundant examples of how the Democrats hate Trump with such burning intensity that they are willing to lionize and mourn a man who was responsible for the deaths of at least 600 Americans, as well as for a great deal more terrorist activity. So whatâ€™s a little treason among America-hating friends? Robert Spencer is the director of Jihad Watch and a Shillman Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center.

NEARLY 200 PEOPLE ARRESTED ACROSS AUSTRALIA FOR DELIBERATELY STARTING BUSHFIRES,https://www.infowars.com/nearly-200-people-arrested-across-australia-for-deliberately-starting-bushfires/,"Authorities in Australia have arrested close to 200 people for deliberately starting the bushfires that have devastated the country, yet the media and celebrities continue to blame â€œclimate changeâ€ for the disaster. The fires have caused at least 18 deaths, destroyed thousands of homes, millions of hectares of land and killed hundreds of millions of animals. A total of 183 people have been arrested by police in Queensland, NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania for lighting bushfires over the last few months, figures obtained by news agency AAP show. In New South Wales, 24 people were arrested for arson, risking prison sentences of up to 25 years. In Queensland, police concluded that 103 of the fires had been deliberately lit, with 98 people, 67 of them juveniles, having been identified as the culprits. â€œThe link between arsonists and the deadly fires that devastate Australia every summer is well known and well documented, with the rate of deliberately lit fires escalating rapidly during the school holiday period,â€ reports Breitbartâ€™s Simon Kent. Around 85 per cent of bushfires are caused by humans either deliberately or accidentally starting them, according to Dr Paul Read, co-director of the National Centre for Research in Bushfire and Arson. â€œAbout 85 per cent are related to human activity, 13 per cent confirmed arson and 37 per cent suspected arson,â€ he said. â€œThe remainder are usually due to reckless fire lighting or even just children playing with fire.â€ Read also highlighted the link between school holidays and kids starting fires, commenting, â€œSchool holidays are a prime time for fire bugs, but especially over summer.â€ The kids have got time to get out there and light, and the most dangerous adults choose hot days.â€ Police are now working on the premise arson is to blame for much of the devastation caused this bushfire season. A strike force will investigate whether blazes were deliberately lit, and bring those responsible to justice. https://t.co/TWh1KQycs4 @ebatten7 #NSWFires #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/Dul8dMFrZv â€” 7NEWS Sydney (@7NewsSydney) January 3, 2020 â€œPolice are now working on the premise arson is to blame for much of the devastation caused this bushfire season,â€ reports 7 News Sydney. New environmental policies that restrict â€œprescribed burning,â€ where land owners burn off flammable ground cover in cooler months in a controlled manner so it doesnâ€™t contribute to bushfires, have also exacerbated the problem. The fact that the bushfires were deliberately started and have nothing to do with man-made climate change hasnâ€™t prevented that being the dominant narrative. Last week, Bernie Sanders blamed those who were â€œdelaying action on climate changeâ€ for â€œthe blood-red sky and unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires.â€ Virtue signaling celebrities have also pounced on the issue to push their dogma, including at the Golden Globes last night when Australian-born Cate Blanchett asserted, â€œWhen one country faces a climate disaster, we all face a climate disaster.â€ 'When one country faces a climate disaster, we all face a climate disaster.' Australian-born Cate Blanchett took to the stage at the #GoldenGlobes to highlight the wildfires fires ravaging her native country and demand action against climate changehttps://t.co/pVuyhgrFDh pic.twitter.com/Bb25YwfQGi â€” ITV News (@itvnews) January 6, 2020 SUBSCRIBE on YouTube: Follow on Twitter: Follow @PrisonPlanet â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” My voice is being silenced by free speech-hating Silicon Valley behemoths who want me disappeared forever.

Flags were spotted flying at half-mast around the country, notably at The Washington Post, The New York Times, and in front of several celebrities' homes. The celebrities went out and bought an American flag for the first time just to fly it at half-mast for this important time of grief. ""The grieving process is painful but necessary,"" said Rep. Ilhan Omar. ""As a nation, we need to stop and grieve this great, austere, revered religious scholar. He was one of the good ones.""

Bloomberg Campaign Vendor Used Prison Labor To Make Presidential Campaign Calls,https://www.npr.org/2019/12/24/791194618/bloomberg-campaign-vendor-used-prison-labor-to-make-presidential-campaign-calls,"Bloomberg Campaign Vendor Used Prison Labor To Make Presidential Campaign Calls Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Makela/Getty Images Mark Makela/Getty Images Billionaire presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg has acknowledged that one of his vendors hired a subcontractor that used prison workers to make phone calls for his 2020 campaign. That prison labor was being used by the Bloomberg campaign was reported Thursday morning by The Intercept. The campaign says it was unaware that inmate workers were making phone calls on its behalf until informed by The Intercept's reporter, and says it immediately cut ties to the vendor. ""Through a third-party vendor, the Mike Bloomberg 2020 campaign contracted New Jersey-based call center company ProCom, which runs calls centers in New Jersey and Oklahoma,"" reporter John Washington writes. ""Two of the call centers in Oklahoma are operated out of state prisons. In at least one of the two prisons, incarcerated people were contracted to make calls on behalf of the Bloomberg campaign."" Sources told The Intercept that some of the calls were made by people incarcerated at the Dr. Eddie Warrior Correctional Center, a minimum-security women's prison near Muskogee, Okla. Bloomberg released a statement a few hours later in which he confirmed the reports: ""Earlier today, a news outlet accurately reported that a subcontractor for one of our vendors was using prison workers to make phone calls on behalf of my campaign. After learning this, we immediately ended our relationship with that company. ""We only learned about this when the reporter called us, but as soon as we discovered which vendor's subcontractor had done this, we immediately ended our relationship with the company and the people who hired them. ""We do not support this practice and we are making sure our vendors more properly vet their subcontractors going forward.""

BARACK OBAMA ANNOUNCES INTENTION TO RUN AS PRESIDENT OF KENYA IN 2021,https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/barack-obama-announces-intention-to-run-as-president-of-kenya-in-2021/,"In a surprise announcement that could upset African politics for years to come, former American President Barack Obama has confirmed this morning his candidacy in the 2021 Kenyan presidential campaign. Son of a Kenyan senior governmental economist, Barack Hussein Obama Sr., the politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017 is actually touring Africa to give a series of conferences. While visiting the Kenyan port city of Mombasa, he was greeted by a large and extremely enthusiastic crowd, loudly cheering and chanting his name. Mr. Obama drew an almost ecstatic roar from the crowd when he made the announcement that he was returning to politics. â€œIâ€™m a bit disgusted with American politics recently while seeing Kenya struggle. I realized I needed to do something to help my Homeland.â€ The former U.S. President believes he can help the country overcome its social and economic problems as he did with the U.S. â€œI was able to solve the U.S.â€™ worse economic crisis in its history and put it on the right track until they elected a narcissistic reality tv star. I can certainly help Kenya.â€ Mr. Obama announced that he was launching his own political party, the National Democratic Party of Kenya (NDP) and confirmed he was considering negotiations with existing parties to form a coalition. Kenya is still struggling with social instability, poverty issues, government corruption, and an important water crisis even if it has recently known a few years of economic growth. Although its economy enjoys the leading position in eastern and central Africa, 39.9% of its population lives below the poverty line, according to the Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative. To make things worse, the country has been struggling with several economic problems recently, the most recent of which is a huge swarm of locust that destroyed swathes of maize, coffee, vegetable, and tea plantations, threatening the countryâ€™s food security. Several experts believe the former American Presidentâ€™s chances of getting elected are extremely good. Many analysts also note that the actual government will certainly hesitate to forbid his candidacy or trick the election if it takes place under international scrutiny. The next Presidential election in Kenya is set for October 2021 and candidates have until April 2021 to confirm their candidacy.","[""kenya"",""candidaci"",""africa"",""u. s."",""obama"",""economic problem"",""mr. obama"",""countri"",""united st"",""mombasa"",""barack hussein obama sr."",""barack obama"",""u. s. presid"",""oxford poverty & human development in"",""national democratic party of kenya"",""american presid"",""october 2021"",""april 2021"",""2009"",""2021"",""2017"",""former american president barack obama"",""former american presidents ch"",""narcissistic reality tv star"",""national democratic parti"",""international scrutini"",""governmental economist"",""important water crisi"",""presidential campaign"",""human development in"",]","[""kenya"",""candidacy"",""africa"",""u. s."",""obama"",""economic problems"",""mr. obama"",""country"",""united states"",""mombasa"",""barack hussein obama sr."",""u. s. president"",""barack obama"",""oxford poverty & human development initiative"",""national democratic party of kenya"",""american presidents"",""october 2021"",""april 2021"",""2009"",""2021"",""2017"",""former american president barack obama"",""former american presidents chances"",""human development initiative"",""narcissistic reality tv star"",""national democratic party"",""international scrutiny"",""countrys food security"",""former u. s. president"",""important water crisis"",]"
Filled with pride: LGBTQ-obsessed mother beats seven-year-old son to death because he refused to dress like a girl,https://www.newstarget.com/2019-12-29-lgbtq-obsessed-mother-beats-son-to-death.html,"Filled with pride: LGBTQ-obsessed mother beats seven-year-old son to death because he refused to dress like a girl Yet another innocent, underage boy has been brutally victimized by the Cult of LGBTQ for refusing to become one of them. Seven-year-old Karol RÃ¡mon, as the media is calling him, was reportedly â€œbeaten with a belt, a chair, a whip and even a hammerâ€ by his lesbian mother, identified as Margarita, simply because he objected to her perverted fetish that he dress like a girl. â€œIn addition to the blow, they left him without food for days,â€ reports further indicate about the unspeakable suffering that Margarita and her partner inflicted on little RÃ¡mon, whoâ€™s just the latest casualty among many of all the â€œtolerance,â€ â€œinclusion,â€ and â€œloveâ€ being pushed on society. By the time Margarita brought RÃ¡mon to a local hospital, he was reportedly already dead, his body â€œfull of bruises, old scars, cigarette burns, and the marks â€˜made by some large object,'â€ relays The Daily Wire about the incident. In the years prior to being viciously murdered by his lesbian mother, RÃ¡mon had been brutally beaten â€œon the head and stomach, causing serious internal damageâ€ by both his mother and her girlfriend, who had tried without success to convert RÃ¡mon into a transgender. RÃ¡monâ€™s grandmother had tried on at least one occasion to gain custody of RÃ¡mon, but was unsuccessful. Margarita has since been arrested and charged with the murder of her son, and will now spend at least four months in pre-trial detention. For related news, be sure to check out Gender.news and Evil.news. Even as good parents are having their children stolen by the state for refusing chemotherapy, LGBTQ demons are murdering underage children without consequence Another very similar gruesome incident recently occurred in Brazil, where another pair of lesbian â€œmomsâ€ murdered their nine-year-old son after cutting off his genitals in a failed attempt to turn him transgender as well â€“ revealing that, sadly, these are no longer obscure incidents, but rather are a true reflection of where the Cult of LGBTQ is headed. Little boys today are now expected to dress up in drag and strip for adult homosexual perverts. And if they donâ€™t, they could find themselves beaten and stabbed to death by their â€œprogressive,â€ LGBTQ parents or their LGBTQ-affirming â€œalliesâ€ for not being â€œtolerantâ€ and â€œlovingâ€ enough. The mainstream media is likewise pushing pedophilia as just another â€œsexual orientation,â€ which means that very soon youâ€™ll probably be hearing about the need for LGBTQP rights â€“ the P standing for pedophiles, which will eventually be just another color on the LGBTQP â€œrainbow.â€ â€œA transgender child is like a vegan cat. We all know whoâ€™s actually making the decisions,â€ wrote one commenter at The Daily Wire. â€œThis is simply a case of a child refusing to go along with the Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy of the parent, and the parent reacting violently at being denied the opportunity of being special.â€ But this is what â€œprideâ€ is all about, after all: embracing and celebrating every form of perversion, including the forced mutilation â€“ and now murder â€“ of children as human sacrifices to Moloch, the god of Planned Parenthood as well as the god of LGBTQP. Contrary to popular belief, pride is not a virtue, despite widespread lies to the contrary. At its root, pride is a vulgar character flaw, and one of the deadly sins warned about in the Bible as preceding a great â€œfall.â€ â€œThe fear of the Lord is hatred of evil,â€ reads Proverbs 8:13. â€œPride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate,â€ says the Lord. â€œGod opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble,â€ also reads James 4:6.

A Cocaine Nasal Spray Just Received FDA Approval,https://merryjane.com/news/a-cocaine-nasal-spray-just-received-fda-approval,"Medicinal cocaine has always been a thing, but now thereâ€™s an FDA-approved nasal spray aptly made with totally legal, pharmaceutical-grade white. On Monday, the pharmaceutical outfit Lannett Company announced that its new cocaine hydrochloride nasal spray product, dubbed Numbrino, cleared two Phase III, randomized, double-blind clinical trials. ""The FDA's approval of our cocaine HCl product, the first NDA approval to include full clinical trials in the company's history, marks a major milestone in Lannett's 70+ years of operations,"" said Tim Crew, Lannett Companyâ€™s CEO, in a press release . ""We believe the product has the potential to be an excellent option for the labeled indication. We expect to launch the product shortlyâ€¦â€ While Lannettâ€™s nasal spray may be new, cocaineâ€™s use in modern medicine is not. Unlike weed, which is considered a Schedule I drug in the US â€” meaning it has no accepted medical use â€” cocaine is a Schedule II drug, meaning it has some accepted medical use. Although cocaineâ€™s medicinal use is not as widespread as it was at the turn of the 20th century , it has been, in rare occasions, administered as a topical analgesic for minor surgeries. Nasal administration of pharmaceutical-grade coke isnâ€™t new, either. In the â€˜80â€™s, LA-based drug researcher Ronald K. Siegel, PhD. tested whether sniffing crack could control arthritis pain. The study successfully showed that snorting pharmaceutical crack â€” or cocaine freebase â€” could effectively manage chronic pain without triggering cocaineâ€™s characteristic, addictive high. However, the patients reported that they felt uncomfortable sniffing lines of any drug for relief, and some study subjects turned to street-bought cocaine after Siegel revealed the study drugâ€™s true identity. Lately, pharmaceutical nasal sprays for novel drugs has become all the rage. Last year, President Trump ordered the VA to purchase an FDA-approved ketamine nasal spray for treating depression in combat veterans. In December, an Oregon-based company announced it would begin developing a nasal spray for delivering psilocybin , the psychedelic component of magic mushrooms. And in case youâ€™re wondering, weed-based nasal sprays have already been around for a few years, but none are FDA-approved. So, there you have it: The US government recognizes cocaine as a legit medicine, but cannabis is still considered as dangerous and useless as heroin.","[""nasal sprai"",""cocain"",""drug"",""us"",""clinical tri"",""product"",""lannett"",""sprai"",""ronald k. siegel"",""tim crew"",""siegel"",""trump"",""lannett compani"",""fda"",""nda"",""the turn of the 20th centuri"",""decemb"",""mondai"",""la-based drug researcher ronald k. siegel"",""pharmaceutical outfit lannett compani"",""pharmaceutical-grade coke isnt"",""new cocaine hydrochlorid"",""street-bought cocain"",""fda-approved ketamin"",""lannett companys ceo"",""pharmaceutical crack"",""oregon-based compani"",""cocaine hcl product"",""medical use cocain"",""psychedelic compon"",]","[""cocaines"",""drug"",""us"",""clinical trials"",""nasal sprays"",""nasal spray"",""product"",""spray"",""ronald k. siegel"",""tim crew"",""siegel"",""trump"",""lannett company"",""fda"",""nda"",""the turn of the 20th century"",""december"",""monday"",""la-based drug researcher ronald k. siegel"",""pharmaceutical outfit lannett company"",""pharmaceutical-grade coke isnt"",""new cocaine hydrochloride"",""street-bought cocaine"",""psychedelic component"",""fda-approved ketamine"",""nasal administration"",""oregon-based company"",""lannett companys ceo"",""pharmaceutical crack"",""medical use cocaine"",]"

But CNN reported on the event with the headline and caption ""Trump voter shot a mentally ill man in a Texas church,"" causing some to question whether CNN might be a biased source of news. ""Once again we see that Trump voters are hopelessly wicked,"" said one somber anchor as footage came in of a shooting in a Texas church.

All this man wanted to do was express his true identity and live out who he really is, and he was stopped by yet another psychotic Trump voter.""

Lake Michigan Dolphin Population On The Rise,https://snickersee.com/2019/09/30/lake-michigan-dolphin-population-on-the-rise/,"The Freshwater Bottlenose Dolphin is making a comeback in the Great Lakes. The species was listed as endangered in the 1960s as a result of over fishing. Sightings of the rare dolphins are on the rise, and scientists say that the population is nearing 2000 dolphins. A report released last week from The Great Lakes Fish and Water Quality Society says, in the 1960s there were less than 100 of the dolphins in Lake Michigan. Numbers are on the rise, and sightings have extended from the Straights of Mackinac, to the Indiana Dunes. Mike Murphy a scientist with The Great Lakes Fish and Water Quality Society spoke with snickersee. â€œThis is really exciting, environmental protection laws enacted in the 1970s are working. We are going to send a team out on the lake next week to track the dolphins, see where they are mating, and their diet. This could be a boost to the lakes natural ecosystem.â€ â€œDolphins might be able to help us control some invasive species that are threatening the Great Lakes,â€ Murphy continued, â€œAsian carp are already in the Illinois river system, and could take over the lake. The dolphins might be able to help curb that population.â€ Scientists are not the only ones excited about the dolphins. The freshwater bottlenose dolphin has been spotted close to shore. Including in some highly congested tourist areas, such as Chicagoâ€™s Navy Pier. â€œItâ€™s wonderful, you can see the Dolphins jumping in the water a few feet from some of the boats. You would think you are on vacation at the ocean,â€ a tourist spending time on the pier told snickersee. The possibilities for tourism in the City of Chicago are endless. There are talks of a boat tour to find the dolphins. This tour would join the several other popular attractions the lake has to offer. City officials hope the dolphin tour would be just as exciting as the architecture boat tour along the Chicago river. â€œI love the dolphins,â€ a sixteen year old girl from suburban Glencoe told snickersee, â€œIâ€™m hoping I can get a selfie with one of them jumping behind me for my instagram.â€ New laws protecting the dolphins State officials are working on new laws to protect the dolphins even further. While it may be tempting to catch one of the animals, it is illegal to fish for them. Officials hope the dolphin population can spread thru the entire Great Lakes region. At one time the dolphins were seen in all of The Great Lakes. The population growth in Lake Michigan shows that one day, the fresh water bottlenose dolphin may be back to where they once had been in numbers.","[""dolphin"",""lake"",""great lak"",""scientist"",""snickerse"",""lake michigan"",""freshwater bottlenose dolphin"",""water quality societi"",""1960"",""great lakes fish"",""new law"",""number"",""sight"",""popul"",""fish"",""rise"",""mackinac"",""chicago"",""illinoi"",""indiana"",""glenco"",""mike murphi"",""murphi"",""city of chicago"",""chicagos navi"",""dolphins st"",""1970"",""2000"",""fresh water bottlenose dolphin"",""environmental protection law"",]","[""dolphins"",""great lakes"",""snickersee"",""lake"",""lake michigan"",""freshwater bottlenose dolphin"",""water quality society"",""1960s"",""great lakes fish"",""population"",""scientists"",""sightings"",""new laws"",""numbers"",""rise"",""mackinac"",""illinois"",""chicago"",""glencoe"",""indiana"",""mike murphy"",""murphy"",""city of chicago"",""dolphins state"",""chicagos navy"",""1970s"",""2000"",""fresh water bottlenose dolphin"",""environmental protection laws"",""dolphins state officials"",]"
Michelle Obama Files For Divorce After Shocking Revelation; Barack Obama Admits: â€˜Iâ€™m Gay!â€™,https://empirenews.net/michelle-obama-files-for-divorce-after-shocking-revelation-barack-obama-admits-im-gay/,"0 PHILADELPHIA, PA Former President Barack Obama announced late last night that he had filed for divorce from his wife of 27 years, Michelle Obama, after he revealed a secret double life as a homosexual. â€œIt is with a bit of sadness and a whole lot of relief that I announce that Michelle and I have decided to separate, as I have admitted to her, as Iâ€™m doing now to the rest of the world, that I am a homosexual,â€ said Barack Obama. â€œThis may come as a shock to many, and anger others, but this is my personal business, and I would hope that everyone could respect my privacy at this timeâ€ Representatives for Michelle Obama said that she and the former president would split amicably, and that Michelle herself was â€œnot particularly shockedâ€ by the revelation. â€œWe are very close, as close as two people could ever be, really,â€ said Michelle in a prepared statement. â€œIâ€™ve known for many years about Barackâ€™s secret life, and I fully support him in the direction that his life takes him. He was and is an incredible leader, a loving father and family man, and now he can go on to make some other guy, or multiple guys, very happy.â€ â€œHonestly, I was prepared to just stay with her,â€ said Barack. â€œI think sheâ€™s secretly know for years that I was gay, and since it already came out in every conservative news site years ago that Michelle was actually born a man, I figured that was close enough. I was prepared to stick it out and keep having young guys on the side. Michelle nixed it, though. She said if this was going to become public news, then thereâ€™s no reason we shouldnâ€™t just split up and reveal our true selves. Whoops, I guess I just proved those rumors about her secret to be true, too. Damn, sorry Michelle!â€ Representatives for the Obama children, Malia and Sasha, could not be reached for comment, but their Facebook pages both were vacant of any comments on the split. 0 Comments comments","[""michel"",""michelle obama"",""barack obama"",""barack"",""homosexu"",""comment"",""year"",""life"",""philadelphia"",""michelle!"",""sasha"",""obama"",""malia"",""pa"",""pa former president barack obama"",""conservative news site year"",""incredible lead"",""obama children"",""former presid"",""prepared stat"",""personal busi"",""facebook pag"",""comments com"",""multiple gui"",""sorry michel"",""loving fath"",""time repres"",""public new"",""family man"",""last night"",]","[""michelle"",""michelle obama"",""barack obama"",""homosexual"",""years"",""life"",""philadelphia"",""michelle!"",""barack"",""sasha"",""obama"",""malia"",""pa"",""pa former president barack obama"",""conservative news site years"",""time representatives"",""prepared statement"",""personal business"",""comments comments"",""incredible leader"",""former president"",""representatives"",""obama children"",""sorry michelle"",""facebook pages"",""loving father"",""multiple guys"",""anger others"",""public news"",""true selves"",]"

Authorities Seize 12 Tons of Smuggled Beaver Penises,https://socialnewsdaily.com/89153/police-seize-12-tons-of-smuggled-beaver-penises/,"Social Media Customs officers in China confiscated over 12 tons of beaver genitals in the countryâ€™s largest-ever smuggling case pertaining to animal parts. A total of 94 bags carrying thousands of beaver schlongs each were impounded onboard a Canadian ship ferrying mostly minerals and wood products. Approximately 500,000 to 600,000 beavers must have been slain to generate the 12.7 tons of penises, reports Xinhua News Agency. Beaver phalluses are implemented in traditional Chinese medicine to increase sexual vigor and remedy erectile dysfunction, according to state media. The Chinese General Administration of Customs held a lengthy press conference Wednesday morning to rationalize why it recovered what many Chinese recognize as valid medicine. â€œItâ€™s probably enough medicine to give an entire generation some erections worthy of bulls, but it comes from shady sources and could also be dangerous.â€ Premised on cited black-market prices for the scutes, the customs agency projects the nabbed genitalia would have been worth more than $23 million. â€œThe investigation to identify the criminal organization behind this smuggling operation is still underway but it was dealt a serious economic blow today.â€ China is hands down the worldâ€™s biggest market for animal body parts trafficking. Experts forecast the market value of illegally imported animal parts on the Chinese market between $45 and 50 billion USD. Various species all over the planet are on the brink of extinction because poachers ceaselessly hunt them to appease the Chinese market, including pangolins, Siberian tigers, and rhinos.

Virginia Democrats Push Legislation to Make Criticism of Government Officials a Criminal Offense,https://bigleaguepolitics.com/virginia-democrats-push-legislation-to-make-criticism-of-government-officials-a-criminal-offense/,"In the wake of the Virginia gun rights rally on Monday, Democrats in the Capitol are not slowing down their push for tyranny. They are moving a bill through the legislature that would effectively criminalize dissent against Governor Blackface Northam and other state government officials. House Bill 1627 was introduced by Delegate Jeffrey M. Bourne last week. The legislation â€œprovides that certain crimes relating to threats and harassment may be prosecuted in the City of Richmond if the victim is the Governor, Governor-elect, Lieutenant Governor, Lieutenant Governor-elect, Attorney General, or Attorney General-elect, a member or employee of the General Assembly, a justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia, or a judge of the Court of Appeals of Virginia.â€ Language in the bill explicitly criminalizes free speech, in what would constitute a blatant attack on the 1st Amendment of the Constitution. Trending: Hospital Exec Who Called for Trump Supporters with Coronavirus to â€˜Give Up Their Ventilatorsâ€™ and Die is Fired â€œIf any person, with the intent to coerce, intimidate, or harass any person, shall use a computer or computer network to communicate obscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language, or make any suggestion or proposal of an obscene nature, or threaten any illegal or immoral act, he is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor,â€ the legislation reads. take our poll - story continues below Are Democrats and the Fake News Media rooting for the Wuhan coronavirus to destroy the economy to remove Trump?

Tina Freitas, wife of Republican Delegate Nick Freitas, called attention to this intolerable act in a Facebook post on Tuesday night. â€œWow on cue, now they are after the 1A! Dems are trying to set up special rules exclusive to the Elite ruling class, to protect themselves from criticism!â€ Freitas wrote. â€œWhat is considered harassment?

They moved red flag laws through the legislature just a day later, and subsequently killed pro-gun bills that were introduced by Republicans. â€œThe governor and the leadership of the democrats have declared war on law-abiding citizens and gun owners and their votes today just confirmed that thatâ€™s where weâ€™re going,â€ said Philip Van Cleave, President of Virginia Citizens Defense League.

Nancy Pelosi Fined $40K for Destruction of Government Property,https://tatersgonnatate.com/nancy-pelosi-fined-40k-for-destruction-of-government-property/,"Nancy Pelosi went too far when she ripped up the Presidentâ€™s speech. According to federal statute USC Title 26 SS197, all speeches given before Congress are to be preserved by the Speaker of the House and delivered to the National Archives for safekeeping. Pelosi wasnâ€™t just disrespectful â€” she broke the law. While there is no jail term for the offense, the fine is clear: â€œThe Speaker will pay a fine equal to one-tenth of a Presidential salary.â€ As of now, that fine is $40K, even though Trump doesnâ€™t technically take a salary. The Department of Justice says they will enforce the rule, according to Chief Prosecutorial Director, Art Tubolls: â€œThe fine is automatic even though it hasnâ€™t been enforced since Tip Oâ€™Neil spit on Reaganâ€™s 1982 SOTU speech and refused to hand it over. It was only $20K then, but he paid it. Nancy Pelosi will pay this fine or find herself in contempt of a Justice Department directive, which does carry a jail sentence. â€œThis wasnâ€™t a smart thing to do. Hopefully, the voters of America will take notice and vote against her in the next Speakerâ€™s race.â€ Pelosiâ€™s office hasnâ€™t commented, but those closest to her say sheâ€™ll gladly pay the fine: â€œNancy would pay millions to make sure that pile of garbage never makes it to the National Archives. The man performed a Medal of Freedom ceremony for a racist, bigoted piece of trash who denigrates people for ratings. The whole thing was full of hyperbole and lies.â€ President Trump is expected to go on a multi-day Twitter campaign to make sure the whole world knows just how upset he is that someone disrespected him, something he would never do publicly to someone else. We here at ALLOD thought the speech was lovely and we look forward to reading the whole thing on our next trip through Washington. God Bless you, Mr. President.

TRUMP IS BLOWING UP A NATIONAL MONUMENT IN ARIZONA TO MAKE WAY FOR THE BORDER WALL,https://theintercept.com/2020/02/06/border-wall-construction-organ-pipe/,"Contractors working for the Trump administration are blowing apart a mountain on protected lands in southern Arizona to make way for the presidentâ€™s border wall. The blasting is happening on the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a tract of Sonoran Desert wilderness long celebrated as one of the nationâ€™s great ecological treasures, that holds profound spiritual significance to multiple Native American groups. In a statement to The Intercept, U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that the blasting began this week and will continue through the end of the month. â€œThe construction contractor has begun controlled blasting, in preparation for new border wall system construction, within the Roosevelt Reservation at Monument Mountain in the U.S. Border Patrolâ€™s Tucson Sector,â€ the statement said, referring to an area also known as Monument Hill. â€œThe controlled blasting is targeted and will continue intermittently for the rest of the month.â€ The agency added that it â€œwill continue to have an environmental monitor present during these activities as well as on-going clearing activities.â€ Rep. RaÃºl Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat and chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, told The Intercept that he has zero faith that the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s â€œenvironmental monitor will do anything to avoid, mitigate, or even point out some of the sacrilegious things that are occurring and will continue to occur, given the way theyâ€™re proceeding.â€ Grijalvaâ€™s blunt assessment is based on a visit he made to Organ Pipe last month, alongside archaeologists and leaders of the Tohono Oâ€™odham Nation, whose ancestral homelands and sacred burial sites are in the crosshairs of President Donald Trumpâ€™s border wall expansion. One of those burial sites lies just beyond the westward advance of the border wall, Grijalva explained. â€œItâ€™s right in the path,â€ he said, meaning that â€œthe one indignation of the blasting on the hill is shortly to follow with other indignations and disrespect.â€ According to Grijalava, â€œDHS had mentioned to the tribes that they would back off on developing the hill, but the work is still being done.â€ The agency has consistently failed in its legal obligation to meaningfully consult with tribal stakeholders in southern Arizona, Grijalva said. The blasting thatâ€™s happening now, he added, â€œis just the crudest indication of whatâ€™s going on.â€ Celebrated as â€œa pristine example of an intact Sonoran Desert ecosystem,â€ Organ Pipe was designated as a UNESCO International Biosphere Reserve in 1976. Even before the explosions began, the construction there was already one of Trumpâ€™s most controversial border wall projects, unfolding on the homelands of the Tohono Oâ€™odham and in areas that are ostensibly safeguarded by the strictest public-land designations on the books. Neither factor has stopped contractors from drilling into the ground and draining water from a rare desert aquifer in order to mix concrete to support a towering, 30-foot barrier along the U.S.-Mexico divide. In working to fulfill the presidentâ€™s chief campaign promise, construction crews on Organ Pipe have uprooted saguaro cacti, slicing the iconic plants into chunks and bulldozed a wide roadway to make room for trucks, cranes, and other construction vehicles. â€œA historically significant area is going to be changed irreparably. Youâ€™re never going to be able to put it back together.â€ With the wall in place, and its floodlights illuminating the area through the night, the migration of several rare desert animal species is expected to come to an end. The construction is particularly threatening to Quitobaquito Springs, the only naturally occurring source of fresh water for miles around. The desert oasis was once inhabited by the Hia Ced Oâ€™odham â€” a smaller, though distinct Oâ€™odham tribe â€” and remains a monumentally important spiritual site for the Oâ€™odham people to this day. â€œA historically significant area is going to be changed irreparably,â€ Grijalva said. â€œYouâ€™re never going to be able to put it back together.â€ Photo: Courtesy of Laiken Jordahl The expansion of the border wall under Trump has been made possible, in part, by a post-9/11 piece of legislation known as the Real ID Act, which grants DHS sweeping authority to waive existing laws in order to construct border barriers. The Trump administration has used the act to waive dozens of laws â€” from the Environmental Protection Act to the Endangered Species Act â€” in order to push through new border wall construction projects. In Arizona, the administrationâ€™s efforts have been bolstered by the fact that federal lands, rather than private property, comprise much of the border. Following his visit to Organ Pipe last month, Grijalva, sent a letter to Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf, expressing â€œserious concernsâ€ that the department was â€œnot respecting tribal lands and sacred sites as they proceed with border wall plans and construction.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s particularly frightening right now is that Trump has weaponized DHS, politically weaponized them.â€ Accompanying Grijalvaâ€™s complaint was a letter from Ned Norris Jr., chair of the Tohono Oâ€™odham Nation, to the U.S. Border Patrol, in which Norris reported that border wall construction on Organ Pipe had already â€œresulted in the inadvertent discovery of human remainsâ€ near Quitobaquito Springs. â€œItâ€™s been really frustrating,â€ Grijalva said. â€œYou would think that in a situation like this, that involves human remains, burial sites, bone fragments that are traced and dated a thousand years or more back, that there would be some sensitivity, for lack of a better word, on the part of DHS and the administration. There is none.â€ The entire episode is deeply political, Grijalva said, with the Trump administration clearly bent on completing as many new miles of wall construction as possible ahead of the 2020 election. â€œWhatâ€™s particularly frightening right now is that Trump has weaponized DHS, politically weaponized them,â€ Grijalva explained. â€œAnd so right now, itâ€™s about satisfying that political agenda.â€ â€œThe consequence of that, the intended consequence of that, is situations like this,â€ Grijalva said. â€œSituations like South Texas. The flooding of public lands. The loss of habitat. The list goes on.â€ Thread update: Explosives truck spotted today just north of Organ Pipe. pic.twitter.com/pLydPVo0Z6 â€” Laiken Jordahl (@LaikenJordahl) February 5, 2020 With the realities of border wall expansion in southern Arizona coming into grim focus over the past few months, advocates on the ground have worried that construction on Organ Pipe might involve explosives. Though the monument is a desert, it is hardly flat. Just west of Arizonaâ€™s Lukeville port of entry from Mexico is Monument Hill, a rolling mound of earth that is not conducive to the kind of border wall construction that has rapidly unfolded elsewhere in the area. Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner for the Center for Biological Diversity, first got word the blasting was happening on Tuesday. He drove down from Tucson the next morning to investigate. A former National Park Service employee at Organ Pipe, Jordahl has consistently documented the monumentâ€™s destruction. At a gas station on his way to Organ Pipe on Wednesday, Jordahl spotted a construction vehicle adorned in yellow cautionary signs that read: â€œExplosives.â€","[""grijalva"",""organ pip"",""trump"",""dh"",""arizona"",""construct"",""month"",""area"",""southern arizona"",""trump administr"",""explos"",""situat"",""order"",""what"",""wai"",""quitobaquito spr"",""mexico"",""laiken jordahl"",""jordahl"",""tohono oodham n"",""monument hil"",""border wall construct"",""controlled blast"",""significant area"",""human remain"",""burial sit"",""border wal"",""contractor"",""statement"",""intercept"",]","[""grijalva"",""organ pipe"",""trump"",""dhs"",""arizona"",""construction"",""month"",""trump administration"",""southern arizona"",""whats"",""order"",""area"",""way"",""quitobaquito springs"",""mexico"",""laiken jordahl"",""jordahl"",""tohono oodham nation"",""monument hill"",""border wall construction"",""controlled blasting"",""significant area"",""human remains"",""burial sites"",""border wall"",""contractors"",""situations"",""explosives"",""department"",""statement"",]"
"Arizona national monument, home to sacred Native American burial sites, is being blown up for the border wall",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/organ-pipe-cactus-national-monument-blasts-arizona-national-monument-being-blown-up-for-border-wall-2020-02-07/,"A national monument in Arizona, home to rare species and sacred Native American burial sites, is being blown up this week as part of construction for President Trump's border wall, Customs and Border Protection confirmed to CBS News. ""Controlled blasting"" inside Arizona's Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument began this week without consultation from the Native American nation whose ancestral land it affects, according to the congressman whose district includes the reservation. ""There has been no consultation with the nation,"" said Congressman RaÃºl Grijalva of Arizona, who is the chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources and whose district contains the reservation and shares 400 miles of border with Mexico. ""This administration is basically trampling on the tribe's history â€” and to put it poignantly, it's ancestry."" Customs and Border Protection told CBS News that the blasts are in preparation for ""new border wall system construction, within the Roosevelt Reservation at Monument Mountain in the U.S. Border Patrol's Tucson Sector."" The explosions are occurring on Monument Hill, a burial site for the Tohono O'odham Nation, according to Grijalva. The border wall cannot be constructed on the Native American reservation because it is private land. The nation's burial sites, however, which Grijalva said are ""immediately adjacent"" to the reservation, are on public land, making them fair game for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Customs and Border Protection. Grijalva sent a letter to Homeland Security on January 7, expressing his ""serious concerns"" over the wall's construction on historically tribal land. He urged the department to consult the nation ""government-to-government,"" before moving forward with construction. He has not heard back. ""There's been stonewalling, no response for any request,"" he said. Weeks before construction began, Grijalva â€” along with Tohono O'odham elders, chairman Ned Norris Jr, and archaeologists â€” toured the nation's sacred ceremonial sites, located within Organ Pipe. The group saw rock piles and burial sites with bone fragments dating back thousands of years. One burial site, known as Las Playas, contained artifacts that go back 10,000 years. ""What we saw on Monument Hill was opposing tribes who were respectfully laid to rest â€” that is the one being blasted with dynamite,"" Grijalva said. In addition to the monument's cultural significance, the land is also a designated UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, an international effort to ""conserve samples of the world's ecosystems."" ""The Organ Pipe Cactus Biosphere Reserve is a first-generation biosphere reserve created in 1976 for the conservation of the unique resources representing a pristine example of an intact Sonoran Desert ecosystem,"" according to the National Park Service's website. ""The biosphere designation has helped to attract scientists from around the world to Organ Pipe Cactus to conduct a variety of important studies to help us better understand the Sonoran Desert and the impact of humans on this amazing landscape."" Like other remote land that the border wall will bisect, many people are concerned with how the unnatural barrier will irreparably impact Organ Pipe's unique habitat. Customs and Border Patrol says they have an ""environmental monitor"" present during the blasts and other ""on-going clearing activities,"" but would not clarify to CBS News what the monitor is doing, or who they are. The Trump administration has been able to legally construct the border wall over public land due in large part to a little known law passed in the wake of the 9/11. The REAL ID Act of 2005 gives the federal government broad power to waive other laws that stand in the way of national security. Under REAL ID, the Trump administration has waived dozens of laws â€” including the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Environmental Protection Act â€” in its bid to construct the border wall. ""Of the 21 times the (REAL ID) waiver has been enacted since 2005, 16 of those instances have occurred in the last two and a half years,"" reads the letter Grijalva sent to Homeland Security. According to the congressman, construction of the border wall has been expedited in Arizona due to an abundance of public land. In Texas, another border state, building the wall has been slowed because it is largely private land. Efren Olivares, director of the racial and economic justice program at the Texas Civil Rights Project, told the Pacific Standard last year that the REAL ID has essentially eliminated federal laws protecting public land. ""The idea that the secretary of (the) DHS could come to your community and say no laws apply here, what kind of rule of law is that?"" Olivares said. ""People should be outraged to know that Homeland Security can wield that kind of power."" Grijalva said repealing REAL ID has been a priority of his for many years. He plans to convene a hearing of the House Committee on Natural Resources' subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples in the coming weeks to address the impact of the wall â€” and waiver â€” on Native American communities. In his letter to Homeland Security, Grijalva wrote: ""Using this waiver to avoid essential federal government responsibilities to tribes is unnecessary, reckless, and counter to the Department's own policy.""","[""grijalva"",""homeland secur"",""border wal"",""public land"",""construct"",""real id"",""custom"",""week"",""arizona"",""trump"",""border protect"",""cbs new"",""depart"",""burial sit"",""nation"",""reserv"",""waiver"",""year"",""wall"",""law"",""house committee on natural resourc"",""2005"",""trump administr"",""house committe"",""private land"",""monument hil"",""congressman"",""organ pip"",""district"",""consult"",]","[""grijalva"",""homeland security"",""border wall"",""construction"",""public land"",""customs"",""real id"",""arizona"",""trump"",""border protection"",""department"",""cbs news"",""reservation"",""nation"",""waiver"",""wall"",""house committee on natural resources"",""2005"",""trump administration"",""house committee"",""monument hill"",""consultation"",""private land"",""congressman"",""burial site"",""organ pipe"",""district"",""blasts"",""impact"",""letter"",]"
Native burial sites blown up for US border wall,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51449739,"Image copyright Laiken Jordahl/Center for Biological Diversity Image caption Cacti that are over 200 years old and have sacred significance have been chopped down Native American burial sites have been blown up by construction crews building the US-Mexico border wall, says a lawmaker and tribal leaders. Authorities confirmed that ""controlled blasting"" has begun at Arizona's Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a Unesco recognised natural reserve. Raul Grijalva, a Democratic congressman, told the Intercept the destruction is ""sacrilegious"". The government failed to consult the Tohono O'odham Nation, he said. Environmental groups also warn of the damage being done to the local underground aquifer, as well as to migrating wildlife in the remote desert region about 115 miles (185km) west of Tucson. Officials say the aim of the project is to construct a 30ft-tall (9m) steel barrier that runs for 43 miles on the national park land. What is Organ Pipe? The United Nations designated Organ Pipe as an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976, calling it ""a pristine example of an intact Sonoran Desert ecosystem"". Mr Grijalva, the chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, represents a district that encompasses the area, which shares 400 miles of border with Mexico. Image copyright Laiken Jordahl/Center for Biological Diversity Image caption Construction on Monument Hill above saguaro cacti He toured the burial sites at the Organ Pipe, known as Monument Hill, last month, and was told that O'odham people buried warriors from the rival Apache tribe there. ""What we saw on Monument Hill was opposing tribes who were respectfully laid to rest - that is the one being blasted with dynamite,"" Mr Grijalva said. Image copyright Getty Images In interviews with US media, he called the Trump administration's conduct ""sacrilegious"" and said the environmental monitor that the government assigned to the project would do nothing to mitigate the cultural damage. One area contained artefacts dating back 10,000 years. Tribal chairman Ned Norris Jr told the Arizona Republic that even though the land is now controlled by the US government, ""we have inhabited this area since time immemorial."" ""They're our ancestors. They're our remnants of who we are as a people, throughout this whole area. And it's our obligation, it's our duty to do what is necessary to protect that."" An internal report from the National Park Service obtained by the Washington Post says the border wall Mr Trump promised during his 2015 campaign would destroy up to 22 archeological sites within Organ Pipe alone. Crews are reported to have also destroyed ancient saguaro cacti, which Mr Grijalva said the O'odham people see ""as the embodiment of their ancestors"". ""So to see them turned into mulch - it's deeply upsetting."" Is this legal? The Trump administration has been able to build sections of the US-Mexico border wall on public land due to the 2005 REAL ID Act, which gives the federal government the right to waive laws that conflict with US national security policy. In their bid to build the wall, the White House has waived dozens of laws - including ones that protected Native American graves, endangered species, and the environment. Mr Grijalva said he will work towards repealing the 2005 act and will convene a congressional hearing in the coming weeks in an effort to do so.

"Rush Limbaugh Calls Troops â€˜Welfare Queens, Moochersâ€™",https://www.duffelblog.com/2013/10/rush-limbaugh-calls-troops-welfare-queens-moochers/,"PALM BEACH, FL â€” From the upscale Palm Beach corporate headquarters of his Excellence in Broadcasting Network, right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh unloaded on Americaâ€™s men and women in uniform, insinuating their motives as less than pure. The comments came during Limbaughâ€™s second hour on Monday. A caller had voiced support for President Obamaâ€™s signature Affordable Health Care Act, the crowning achievement of Obamaâ€™s administration thus far and a piece of legislation that conferred health care coverage on 40 million of the nationâ€™s poor and middle class. When the caller identified himself as a retired Army Master Sergeant, and compared the AFA to the militaryâ€™s free medical care for all servicemembers and their families, Limbaugh cut him off and began the controversial response. â€œYou see, Master Sergeant,â€ began Limbaugh, rubbing his hands together, â€œyou have exposed yourself. I thank you for the call â€” and I thank you for your service, I really do â€” but youâ€™ve exposed yourself. Of course you like the idea of the government putting a band-aid on every little boo-boo you get, wiping your nose for you, giving you free prescription Advil when you could buy it at the drug store like the taxpayer, so on and so forth. You like that idea because youâ€™ve lived with that your whole life. You said you joined the Army at 18. My guess is that before that, before you enlisted, you were on welfare. When you joined, you were essentially on welfare, because whether or not you ever go to war, you get free medicine, free food, free place to sleep, even free clothes to wear to work every day. The taxpayer even gives you years-long paid vacations to exotic foreign lands. Iâ€™m not saying youâ€™re not appreciative, but when youâ€™re used to people giving you free ice cream for forty years, if you suddenly have to pay for your own ice cream, youâ€™ll understandably be upset. â€œYouâ€™ll also probably think, wellâ€”â€ and here Limbaugh inclined the intonation of his voice to imitate that of a child, â€œMr. Limbaugh, if only everyone could have fwee ice cream, Mr. Limbaugh, then the world would be all sunshine and unicorns and happiness. The only problem,â€ continued Limbaugh, returning to his normal voice, â€œis that ice cream, folks, like health care, is not free. It is a product, created by a producer. And you have just as much a right to getting it for free as you have to getting ice cream for free. That is, you do not have a right to it for free. And if you believe otherwise, you are not a defender of the nation. Youâ€™re a welfare queen â€” or more appropriately, a welfare grunt.â€ Mr. Limbaugh then launched into a tangent on what he called the â€œdistressing trendâ€ heâ€™s noticed in younger servicemembers to be supporters of the President. â€œIt used to be, back when I was of age to serve, back in the Vietnam era, that soldiers were stout, upright, conservative young men. They were Southern. They voted Republican. Their wives stayed home and had babies and knew their place. Cooked dinner, had a highball waiting when the husband got home, so forth. But nowadays we have a new generation of young military youth â€” low-information voters raised on liberal propaganda like Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers and PBS, what have you. Get their news from the drive-by media. They learned welfare, mooching, kumbaya and hand-holding from those sources. They learned mooching from an early age, folks. And even in uniform, still moochers. Canâ€™t change a leopardâ€™sâ€¦.well, in this case, you can change a leopardâ€™s spots, folks. But heâ€™s still a leopard. Still a moocher. A little Obama jihadist, ready to march out and drone-attack American citizens in Yemen or Pakistan.â€ When reached for comment, Clear Channel Communications, which carries Limbaughâ€™s show on over 400 stations nationwide and dozens overseas, distanced itself from Limbaughâ€™s comments. â€œClear Channel honors our servicemen and women and the great sacrifice they make every day to keep us free and safe. For that reason, we offer Rush Limbaughâ€™s show to them free of charge via Armed Forces Network in over thirty countries around the world. The views of one radio host, even one who accounts for over half of our ad revenue, do not in any way reflect the views of Clear Channel.â€","[""limbaugh"",""mr. limbaugh"",""welfar"",""folk"",""ice cream"",""leopard"",""uniform"",""support"",""moocher"",""comment"",""nation"",""taxpay"",""caller"",""youll"",""women"",""world"",""right"",""your"",""view"",""idea"",""home"",""dai"",""palm beach"",""pakistan"",""vietnam"",""yemen"",""fl"",""obama"",""roger"",""affordable health care act"",]","[""limbaugh"",""mr. limbaugh"",""welfare"",""folks"",""limbaughs"",""ice cream"",""taxpayer"",""uniform"",""caller"",""youll"",""women"",""youre"",""world"",""right"",""views"",""idea"",""home"",""day"",""palm beach"",""pakistan"",""vietnam"",""yemen"",""fl"",""rogers"",""obama"",""clear channel communications"",""affordable health care act"",""broadcasting network"",""armed forces network"",""army master sergeant"",]"
White: I Saw Trump Riding Golden Horse Alongside Jesus During Armageddon,https://thebiznews.org/2020/01/08/white-i-saw-trump-riding-golden-horse-alongside-jesus-during-armageddon/,"By Piper Blackmun The world seems to have breathed a sigh of relief as America and Iran have pulled back from the brink of war. On Wednesday morning, President Donald Trump gave another rambling, slurred speech where he talked about making peace with the country who he recently threatened to attack. However, fundamentalist Christians, who are among Trumpâ€™s staunchest supporters, seem to be encouraging Trumpâ€™s warmongering. Many of them, such as Sec. of State Mike Pompeo, believe these are the End of Days and Trump will lead us into an apocalyptic war with Islam. â€œBoth Mike Pompeo and Mike Pence who have pushed Trump towards aggressive action towards Iran believe that there is a battle between good and evil that will end with â€˜the Raptureâ€™. A key belief of the evangelical Christian extremists is the establishment of a â€˜greater Israelâ€™ before the end of days,â€ according to the British website Church and State. According to spiritual shyster and Trump advisor Paula White, Trump will have a role in the final battle. â€œGod came to me last night and showed me a vision of Trump riding alongside Jesus on a horse made of gold and jewels,â€ said White in Charisma, a fundie publication. â€œThis means he will play a critical role in Armageddon as the United States stands alongside Israel in the battle against Islam.â€ But even more scary, these kinds of delusional fantasies are widespread on the far- right. Former televangelist Jim Bakker is also a staunch Trump fan and believes he will save Israel. â€œHe (Trump) keeps signing things to protect the church, and heâ€™s helped Israel, and recognized Israel.

"Rush Limbaugh Admits Presidential Medal Of Freedom Less Of An Honor Knowing That Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou Also Received It",https://politics.theonion.com/rush-limbaugh-admits-presidential-medal-of-freedom-less-1841475204,"WASHINGTONâ€”Saying his initial enthusiasm had faded after learning about the awardâ€™s history, conservative radio personality Rush Limbaugh conceded Wednesday that receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom was less of an honor knowing it had been bestowed upon Rosa Parks and Maya Angelou, too. â€œWhile I understand this medal represents the highest civilian honor possible, I was a bit disconcerted to discover this morning that I share this distinction with both a civil rights icon and a poet who gave a voice to black Americans,â€ said Limbaugh, who explained that he hopes people donâ€™t doubt his integrity as he joins the ranks of the awardâ€™s previous recipients, especially Cicely Tyson, Ralph Ellison, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Stevie Wonder, and Willie Mays. â€œI almost sent it back. But instead I have decided to keep my Medal of Freedom and let it stand as a testament to my willingness to tolerate others. I hope my acceptance of it will go some way toward reclaiming this honor from the Martin Luther Kings and Nelson Mandelas of the world.â€ At press time, Limbaugh confirmed he felt more confident that the award meant something after learning it had also been given to Henry Kissinger and Strom Thurmond.

"In Bold Act Of Defiance, Joel Osteen Rips Up Bible",https://babylonbee.com/news/in-bold-act-of-defiance-joel-osteen-rips-up-bible,"In Bold Act Of Defiance, Joel Osteen Rips Up Bible HOUSTON, TXâ€”During Sunday's service at Lakewood Church, Joel Osteen ripped up a Bible in a bold act of defiance. After the sermon was completed, in a theatrical display of his attitude toward the Scriptures, Osteen stood up and solemnly ripped the Bible in half before tossing it on the ground. ""The Bible shreds my theology, so I shredded the Bible,"" Osteen said afterward, defending his actions. ""I couldn't find one word of truth in this thing. It talked about persecution, trials, tribulations, poverty, hardship, and even the 's-i-n' word. It's repulsive, really."" Some critics noted that Osteen had ""pre-ripped"" the Bible during his sermon so it would tear more easily. Still, it's a pretty thick book, so it took Osteen tremendous effort to tear its thousands of pages. He also spoke words of victory over the book as he ripped it in half. His hands were singed in the attempt, but he was finally able to push through and finish the ceremonial tearing of the Bible. ""It was the courteous thing to do, considering the alternative,"" he added ominously.

Pete Buttigieg Funded by Russian-Linked Oligarch Who Supports Trump and McConnell,https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/pete-buttigieg-funded-by-russian-linked-oligarch-who-supports-trump-and-mcconnell/,"Democratic presidential candidate and former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg is facing questions after recent revelations that his 2020 effort has taken campaign contributions from an infamous Republican Party billionaire with direct links to the Russian oligarchy. Thatâ€™s according Federal Election Commission (FEC) data reviewed by Law&Crime. Previously described in the press as â€œThe Giver,â€ Leonard â€œLenâ€ Blavatnik is a well-known GOP donor with a New York address who previously took it upon himself to fund President Donald Trumpâ€˜s lavish â€” and allegedly criminal â€” inauguration festivities in 2017 to the tune of some $1 million. Now, Blavatnik and his wife are apparently shifting allegiances. As of this writing, they have donated thousands of dollars to Pete for America, Inc., Buttigiegâ€™s official campaign organization. A summer 2017 commentary for the Dallas Morning News by Ruth May catalogues a bit more of Blavatnikâ€™s political spending habits: Donald Trump and the political action committees for Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, Lindsey Graham, John Kasich and John McCain accepted $7.35 million in contributions from a Ukrainian-born oligarch who is the business partner of two of Russian president Vladimir Putinâ€˜s favorite oligarchs and a Russian government bank. Citing public data available via the FEC and from campaign finance data clearinghouse OpenSecrets, May notes that most of Blavatnikâ€™s largesse was distributed among Republicans during the 2015-2016 election campaignâ€“accounting for $6.35 million of the oligarchâ€™s spending up to that point. â€œMitch McConnell was the top [individual] recipient of Blavatnikâ€™s donations, collecting $2.5 million for his GOP Senate Leadership Fund under the names of two of Blavatnikâ€™s holding companies, Access Industries and AI Altep Holdings,â€ she wrote. A January 2019 Quartz article describes another notable expenditure: Trumpâ€™s campaign didnâ€™t receive any Blavatnik cash during the 2016 campaign but he has donated large sums to the Republican National Committeeâ€™s legal fund, which has helped finance Trumpâ€™s legal defense for the Russia probe, according to the Wall Street Journal. Aside from the large sums of campaign cash doled out to leading Republicans, Blavatnik has largely been considered problematic by the media and Beltway establishment because of his documented ties to Vladimir Putin and the Russian leaderâ€™s inner circle. â€œBlavatnikâ€™s relationships with Russian oligarchs close to Putin, particularly Oleg Deripaska, should be worrisome for Trump and the six GOP leaders who took Blavatnikâ€™s money during the 2016 presidential campaign,â€ May wrote in 2017. MSNBCâ€™s Rachel Maddow long and loudly beat the anti-Blavatnik drumâ€“and played up his oligarchical connectionsâ€“while he was mainly known for donating to Republicans and ramped up criticism amidst a controversy that saw Deripaskaâ€™s network delisted from the United Statesâ€™ sanctions regime against the Russian Federation. Liberal outlet Mother Jones reported on those connections in 2019: Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) sent a separate letter probing whether [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin has a personal conflict of interest in the delisting deal. In her letter, first reported by Buzzfeed, Speier noted that prior to taking office Mnuchin owned a movie production company that he sold, in part, to Access Industries, a company owned by Len Blavatnik, a Russian-born billionaire who has ties to Deripaska. Blavatnik sits on the board of a company called SUAL, a major shareholder in Rusal. According to the New York Times, SUALâ€™s stake in Rusal will increase as part of Deripaskaâ€™s deal with the Treasury Department. In short, a man who is believed to have paid Mnuchin as much as $25 million for his movie company may well benefit from the deal to remove Rusal from the sanctions list. Buttigiegâ€™s support from the Blavatnik family, so far, runs in excess of $5,000, according to the FECâ€“close to the maximum allowed by law. And, since making the donations to Buttigiegâ€™s campaign, the Blavatniks have attempted to â€œpurchaseâ€ â€œinfluenceâ€ (as progressives maintain) with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) as well, giving the Democratic Partyâ€™s leading congressional incumbent protection organization well over $400,000 â€” all the while hedging their bets and keeping up similarly-sized donations to the GOP as well, according to publicly-available data collected by the FEC. Giving to both sides is a tactic also employed by some American businesses and business leaders. The former mayorâ€™s support from the so-called â€œRussian-linked oligarchâ€ was first noted by Men4Choice co-founder Justin Horowitz. â€œWow. One of the billionaires powering Pete Buttigiegâ€™s campaign is a Russian-linked oligarch who contributed millions to Trump and GOP PACs for Lindsay Graham, Marco Rubio, Mitch McConnell and Scott Walker,â€ Horowitz noted. â€œYou canâ€™t make this stuff up.â€ â€œ[Rachel Maddow, MSNBC, and] #resistance twitter made multiple media cycles about this donor, saying Russia was taking over America,â€ Horowitz continued â€” responding to left-wing criticism that his language was playing leaning too heavily on the largely discredited Russiagate narrative. â€œOnly reason I said â€˜russian-linkedâ€™ is to point out obvious hypocrisy they engage in on the daily. Billionaire right winger is all that really matters.â€ Law&Crime reached out to the Buttigieg campaign for comment and clarification on this report, but no response was forthcoming at the time of publication.

Tucker Carlson: Criminals would be protected from deportation under bill AOC and other House Democrats back,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-criminals-would-be-protected-from-deportation-under-bill-aoc-and-other-house-democrats-back,"At this moment there is a bill pending in Congress called the New Way Forward Act. Itâ€™s received almost no publicity, which is unfortunate as well as revealing. The legislation is sponsored by 44 House Democrats, including Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. At roughly 4,400 words, itâ€™s almost exactly as long as the U.S. Constitution. Like the Constitution, this legislation is designed to create a whole new country. The bill would entirely remake our immigration system, with the explicit purpose of ensuring that criminals are able to move here, and settle here permanently, with impunity. TUCKER CARLSON: TRUMP'S ACQUITTAL WAS AS PREDICTABLE AS 'TITANIC' - MAYBE NOW WE CAN HAVE OUR COUNTRY BACK You may think weâ€™re exaggerating for effect. Weâ€™re not â€“ not even a little. The New Way Forward act is the most radical single piece of legislation weâ€™ve seen proposed in this country. It makes the Green New Deal look like the status quo. A document produced by Democrats to promote the bill says: â€œConvictions â€¦ should not lead to deportation.â€ Keep in mind, weâ€™re not talking about convictions for double parking. The bill targets felony convictions â€“ serious crimes that send you to prison for years. A press release from Rep., Jesus Garcia, D-Ill., is explicit about this. Garcia brags that the bill will break the â€œprison to deportation pipeline.â€ How does the bill do that? Under current U.S. law, legal U.S. immigrants can be deported if they commit an â€œaggravated felonyâ€ or a â€œcrime of moral turpitudeâ€ â€“ that is, a vile, depraved act, like molesting a child. Under the New Way Forward Act, â€œcrimes of moral turpitudeâ€ are eliminated entirely as a justification for deportation. And the category of â€œaggravated felonyâ€ gets circumscribed too. What does that mean? Consider this: Under current law, immigrants who commit serious crimes â€“ such as robbery, fraud, or child sexual abuse â€“ must be deported, regardless of the sentence they receive. Other crimes â€“ less severe ones like racketeering â€“ require deportation as long as the perpetrator receives at least a one-year sentence. But if this bill passes the House and Senate and is signed into law by the president, there will no longer be any crimes that automatically require deportation. None. And one crime â€“ falsifying a passport â€“ will be made immune from deportation, no matter what. Because apparently 9/11 never happened, and we no longer care about fake government documents. If you just renewed your driverâ€™s license to comply with the Real ID Act, you must feel like an idiot. Under the proposed legislation, the minimum prison sentence for crimes that still require deportation would rise from one year to five. We checked the Bureau of Justice Statistics. According to federal data, crimes like car theft, fraud, and weapons offenses all carry average prison sentences of fewer than five years. And thatâ€™s just looking at averages. There are people who commit rape, child abuse and even manslaughter and receive sentences of fewer than five years. Lots of them. If the New Way Forward Act becomes law, immigrants who commit those crimes and receive those sentences would remain in the country. Theyâ€™ll all be eligible for citizenship one day, too. But even that is understating the lawâ€™s effect. Even a five-year prison sentence wonâ€™t necessarily be enough to secure deportation. The bill would grant sweeping new powers to immigration judges, allowing them to nullify a deportation order. The only requirement is that â€œthe immigration judge finds such an exercise of discretion appropriate in pursuit of humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest.â€ In other words, anti-American immigration judges â€“ and many of them are exactly that â€“ would have a blank check to open the borders. No vote required. Sound shocking to you? Weâ€™re just getting started. Current U.S. law makes drug addiction grounds for deportation, because why wouldnâ€™t it? This bill would eliminate that statute. Current law also states that those who have committed drug crimes abroad, or any â€œcrimes involving moral turpitude,â€ are ineligible to immigrate here. The New Way Forward Act abolishes that statute. A Mexican drug cartel leader could be released from prison, then freely come to America immediately. And if he wants, he could come here illegally, and it wouldnâ€™t be a crime â€“ because, and you were waiting for this, the bill also decriminalizes illegal entry into America, even by those previously deported. According to a document promoting the bill, criminalizing illegal entry into America is â€œwhite supremacist.â€ By this point, youâ€™re beginning to wonder if weâ€™re making this up. Weâ€™re not. In fact, weâ€™re barely halfway through the bill. The legislation doesnâ€™t just make it harder to deport legal immigrants who commit crimes. It doesnâ€™t just make it easier for criminals to legally move here. The bill would also effectively abolish all existing enforcement against illegal immigration. To detain illegal immigrants, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would have to prove in court that the illegal immigrants are dangerous or a flight risk. But of course, ICE wouldnâ€™t be allowed to use a detaineeâ€™s prior criminal behavior as proof he or she is dangerous. That's banned. ICE would have to overcome even more hurdles if the detainee claims to be gay or transgender, under 21, or canâ€™t speak English and an interpreter isnâ€™t immediately available. In other words, it would be much harder to arrest an illegal alien than it is to arrest you. Theyâ€™re the protected class here. Youâ€™re just some loser whoâ€™s paying for it all. But believe it or not, we saved the nuttiest part for last. What could be more destructive than changing U.S. law, specifically to allow rapists, child molesters, and drug dealers to stay in America? How about this: Using taxpayer money to bring deported criminals back into America. Thatâ€™s right. This bill would not only abolish your right to control who lives in your own country, but it invents a new right in return: the â€œright to come home.â€ The bill orders the government to create a â€œpathway for those previously deported to apply to return to their homes and families in the United States,â€ as long as they would have been eligible to stay under the new law. The Department of Homeland Security must spend taxpayer dollars transporting convicted criminal illegal aliens into the United States. Who will be eligible for these free flights? Tens of thousands of people kicked out of this country for all kinds of crimes. Sexual abuse. Robbery. Assault. Drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, human trafficking. From 2002 to 2018, 480,000 people were deported for illegal entry or reentry into America. And under this bill, youâ€™d have to buy them all a plane ticket to come back. The tickets alone would cost about a billion dollars, and thatâ€™s before Democrats make you start paying for these criminalsâ€™ free health care, too. Which they plan to. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER The New Way Forward Act fundamentally inverts every assumption you have about America. Under this legislation, the criminals are the victims. Law enforcement is illegitimate. Itâ€™s racist, just like the country you live in, and the only solution is to get rid of both. America would be better off as a borderless rest area for the worldâ€™s worst predators and parasites. This is a big deal. Itâ€™s hard to believe any American would put these ideas on paper, much less pass them into law. Yet, remarkably, the press has ignored it. Scores of Democrats have backed it, but the bill hasnâ€™t been mentioned in The New York Times, or on CNN, or even in self-described conservative outlets like National Review. If a lone Republican state legislator from Minot, N.D., had proposed a bill this extreme, that would remake America this completely, the president himself would be expected to answer for it. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP CNN would demand the president â€œdisavow,â€ even if he knew nothing about it. But when one-fifth of the Democratic caucus backs a bill demanding that you pay to import illegal alien felons, itâ€™s a non-event in American media. They donâ€™t think you should know about it. Thatâ€™s dangerous. Whether the press cares or not, these are the stakes of the 2020 election. A growing wing of the Democratic Party views America as essentially illegitimate â€“ a rogue state, in which everything must be destroyed and remade: our laws, our institutions, our freedoms, our history and our values. Thatâ€™s the point of all this, of course. An entirely new country, in which resistance is crushed, and theyâ€™re in charge forever.

Suitcase Full Of Dead Birds From China Intercepted At Virginia Airport,https://www.dailywire.com/news/suitcase-full-of-dead-birds-from-china-intercepted-at-virginia-airport,"No matter what the reason, we should all be able to agree that sending a suitcase full of dead birds â€“ from anywhere, to anywhere â€“ is not right. The ordeal is made more disturbing by the fact that the suitcase was sent from China, which is currently dealing with the coronavirus and has struggled in the past with a bird flu epidemic. WTHR reported Monday that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents intercepted a package at Dulles International Airport in Virginia that was filled with small dead birds. â€œAccording to officials, the traveler arrived on a flight from Beijing, China on Jan. 27, 2020 where the travelerâ€™s final destination was to a residence in Prince Georgeâ€™s County, Maryland,â€ the outlet reported. â€œDuring a baggage examination, CBP specialists discovered a package with pictures of a cat and dog that the passenger said was â€˜cat food.â€™ The package, according to officials, contained a bunch of unknown small birds, about 2.5 to 3.5 inches in length.â€ CBP provided disturbing images of the pet-food packaging that does, in fact, contain dead birds. .@CBP agriculture specialists at Dulles airport continue to protect our nationâ€™s vital agricultural resources and our economy by intercepting potential animal threats, like those posed by these tiny dead birds from China packaged as â€œpet food.â€ Read https://t.co/uJj5o5xfmN pic.twitter.com/xTldZ6G6jM â€” CBP Mid-Atlantic (@CBPMidAtlantic) February 10, 2020 As one can imagine, importing dead animals such as birds from China isnâ€™t a good idea. â€œThese dead birds are prohibited from importation to the United States as unprocessed birds pose a potentially significant disease threat to our nationâ€™s poultry industries and more alarmingly to our citizens as potential vectors of avian influenza,â€ said Casey Durst, director of field operations for CBPâ€™s Baltimore Field Office. â€œCustoms and Border Protection agriculture specialists continue to exercise extraordinary vigilance every day in their fight to protect our nationâ€™s agricultural and economic prosperity from invasive pests and animal diseases.â€ CBP published a press release about the find that included an additional quote from Durst. â€œCustoms and Border Protection agriculture specialists protect our nationâ€™s agricultural industries from a variety of potential threats every day, including from highly pathogenic animal diseases that threaten our nationâ€™s economy,â€ Durst continued. â€œCBP agriculture specialists continue to exercise extraordinary vigilance in their fight to protect our nationâ€™s agriculture and economic prosperity from invasive pests and animal diseases.â€ The press release also said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDAâ€™s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) â€œregulate the importation of animals and animal products into the United States.â€ On any given day in 2019, CBP agriculture officials across the country likely â€œseized 4,695 prohibited plant, meat, animal byproduct, and soil, and intercepted 314 insect pests at U.S. ports of entry.â€ As of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that between 2003 and 2020, there were 861 cases of avian influenza reported around the world. An estimated 455 people died due to the virus. China is currently dealing with an epidemic of the coronavirus, which has killed hundreds, possibly thousands, of people in the communist nation already. The WHO suggested on Monday that the deaths so far â€œmay be the tip of the iceberg.â€ It is so far estimated that more than 1,000 people have died from the virus while more than 40,000 were infected.","[""cbp"",""china"",""dead bird"",""nation"",""packag"",""peopl"",""dai"",""united st"",""border protect"",""durst"",""mondai"",""border protection agriculture specialist"",""extraordinary vigil"",""economic prosper"",""avian influenza"",""invasive pest"",""animal diseas"",""press releas"",""coronaviru"",""suitcas"",""travel"",""import"",""custom"",""offici"",""fight"",""viru"",""fact"",""dulles international airport"",""prince georges counti"",""virginia"",]","[""cbp"",""china"",""dead birds"",""nations"",""package"",""people"",""day"",""united states"",""border protection"",""durst"",""monday"",""border protection agriculture specialists"",""extraordinary vigilance"",""economic prosperity"",""avian influenza"",""animal diseases"",""invasive pests"",""press release"",""importation"",""coronavirus"",""officials"",""suitcase"",""customs"",""virus"",""fight"",""fact"",""dulles international airport"",""prince georges county"",""virginia"",""maryland"",]"
"PLANE THAT DISAPPEARED IN BERMUDA TRIANGLE IN 1945 LANDS IN FLORIDA, CREW MEMBERS REMEMBER NOTHING",https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/plane-that-disappeared-in-bermuda-triangle-in-1945-lands-in-florida-crew-members-remember-nothing/,"One of a group of five Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers that disappeared over the Bermuda Triangle on December 5, 1945, mysteriously reappeared this morning at the Patrick Air Force Base in Brevard, Florida. Around 7:15 AM this morning, a single-engine propeller aircraft arrived in the vicinity of the United States Air Force restricted flight zone and used an abandoned military radio frequency to demand permission to land on the installation. The pilot ignored several warnings from the tower operators, insisting that his obsolete aircraft was a military vehicle belonging to the U.S. Air Force. The craft was finally escorted to the airfield by two F-14 jet fighters and landed on the airfield under close scrutiny. The baseâ€™s security staff was extremely surprised to see two disoriented old men wearing WW2 uniforms come out of the cockpit, visibly confused. According to U.S. Air Force spokesman, Colonel James Miller, the two men claimed to be have disappeared in 1945 and have no memory of what happened to them over the last 75 years. â€œThey asked us if the war with Japan was over and who had won. These old guys seemed visibly confused.â€ Colonel Miller says the menâ€™s fingerprints and teeth seem to match the military records of the men they claim to be, Lt. James Monroe and Captain David Smith Jr., but they seem to be much younger than they should. â€œThey look around 65 years old when they should be over 110 years old. Itâ€™s as if they had gotten lost in a type of warp zone where time is slowed.â€ Both men will undergo a thorough medical examination and interrogation to try and determine the veracity of their story and what may have happened to them. The aircraft was authenticated as one of five planes part of Flight 19 which disappeared over the Bermuda Triangle in December 1945. Flight 19 was taking part in routine navigation and combat training exercises in TBM-type aircraft when they lost radio contact and disappeared. None of the planes were ever found, and another craft even disappeared while searching for them. Unfortunately, the two men seem to have no memory of what happened to them during their ordeal, so the mystery remains total concerning the faith of the other aircrafts.","[""men"",""year"",""bermuda triangl"",""u. s. air forc"",""airfield"",""decemb"",""memori"",""flight"",""craft"",""morn"",""florida"",""brevard"",""japan"",""colonel james mil"",""david smith jr."",""james monro"",""miller"",""united states air forc"",""patrick air force bas"",""grumman tbm aveng"",""december 5, 1945"",""december 1945"",""last 75 year"",""1945"",""single-engine propeller aircraft"",""u. s. air force spokesman"",""captain david smith jr."",""combat training exercis"",""military radio frequ"",""bases security staff"",]","[""men"",""years"",""bermuda triangle"",""u. s. air force"",""december"",""airfield"",""morning"",""flight"",""memory"",""craft"",""florida"",""brevard"",""japan"",""colonel james miller"",""david smith jr."",""james monroe"",""miller"",""united states air force"",""patrick air force base"",""grumman tbm avenger"",""december 5, 1945"",""last 75 years"",""december 1945"",""1945"",""single-engine propeller aircraft"",""combat training exercises"",""u. s. air force spokesman"",""military radio frequency"",""captain david smith jr."",""bases security staff"",]"

According to U.S. Air Force spokesman, Colonel James Miller, the two men claimed to be have disappeared in 1945 and have no memory of what happened to them over the last 75 years. The soldiers asked the management of Airport if the war with Japan was over and who had won. These old guys seemed physically arranged. Colonel Miller was reported to have said that the menâ€™s fingerprints and teeth seemed to match the military records of the men they claimef to be, Lt. James Monroe and Captain David Smith Jr., but they seemed to be much younger than they should. â€œThey look around 65 years old when they should be over 110 years old. Itâ€™s as if they had gotten lost in a type of warp zone where time is slow.â€ Both men as Reported by Time news will now undergo a thorough medical examination and interrogation to try and determine the veracity of their story and what may have happened to them.

Largest Planet-Killer Asteroid To Approach Earth This Month Arriving On Saturday,https://www.ibtimes.com/largest-planet-killer-asteroid-approach-earth-month-arriving-saturday-2921210,"KEY POINTS NASA spots a planet-killer asteroid approaching Earth The approaching space rock is a potentially hazardous asteroid The asteroid is big enough to cause a major impact event A potentially hazardous asteroid thatâ€™s big enough to trigger a nuclear winter and mass extinction events on Earth following a collision will intersect the planetâ€™s path this weekend. According to the data collected by NASA, the approaching asteroid is larger than the tallest man-made structure in the world. NASAâ€™s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) has identified the incoming asteroid as 163373 (2002 PZ39). As indicated in CNEOSâ€™ database, this asteroid is currently traveling toward Earth at a speed of almost 34,000 miles per hour. CNEOS estimated that 163373 (2002 PZ39) has a diameter of around 3,250 feet, making it significantly bigger than the Burj Dubai, which is currently the tallest building in the world. Given its incredible size, 163373 (2002 PZ39) will be the biggest asteroid to approach Earth this month. According to CNEOS, 163373 (2002 PZ39) is an Apollo asteroid, which means it is known to intersect Earthâ€™s path around the Sun from time to time. Due to its dangerous orbit and massive size, approaching space rock has been labeled as a potentially hazardous asteroid. â€œPotentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) are currently defined based on parameters that measure the asteroidâ€™s potential to make threatening close approaches to the Earth,â€ NASA explained in a statement. Since 163373 (2002 PZ39) follows an Earth-crossing orbit, it has a chance of colliding with Earth every time it passes the planet. If the asteroid collides with Earth, it will cause a major impact event. NASA and other space agencies have warned that kilometer-sized asteroids can do a lot of damage to Earth. If 163373 (2002 PZ39) hits the planet, its initial blast would instantly kill off millions. Then, due to its size, the energy from its explosion would be enough to trigger a global nuclear winter that could last for years. The harsh environmental changes triggered by the asteroidâ€™s impact could lead to the mass extinction of different species. According to CNEOS, 163373 (2002 PZ39)â€™s near-Earth intersection will happen on Feb. 15 at 6:05 a.m. EST. During this time, the asteroid will pass over the planet from a distance of 0.03860 astronomical units or around 3.6 million miles away.

Mike Bloomberg Threatens Trump After Buying All His Debt,https://www.gishgallop.com/mike-bloomberg-threatens-trump-after-buying-all-his-debt/,"New York, NY â€” In what many analysts are calling a brilliant political and financial maneuver, former New York City mayor, millionaire and now former Democrat presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg said heâ€™d purchased all of Donald Trumpâ€™s debt for pennies on the dollar. â€œItâ€™s always been in the plan to do this,â€ said Mr. Bloomberg speaking with a medium-sized crowd in Austin, Texas yesterday. â€œItâ€™s all a part of our goal to rescue the country from Donald Trump. And it was inexpensive as you might imagine. Like everything else in Donaldâ€™s life, even his debt is worthless, and we got it for a song and a dance.â€ Itâ€™s what Bloomberg is doing or not doing with the debt that has rocked the political world. â€œThere are several things Bloomberg could do with Trumpâ€™s debt,â€ said the University of Chicagoâ€™s Professor James Badwater of the James Badwater Institute of Public Policy and Veterinary Ethics. â€œWhat heâ€™s probably going to do is is start collections proceedings against the President. This will allow him to see all of his tax returns and other sensitive financial records. Or he could threaten to do that, which will keep Trump off keel.â€ Mr. Bloomberg had no issue sharing the amount he paid for Trumpâ€™s debt. â€œHe has a lot more than you think. More than we even thought,â€ continued Mr. Bloomberg to the Austin crowd. â€œBillions. But we were able to get all of it for just under 240 million [dollars]. Deutsche Bank was happy to unload over 1 billion at a 90% discount. And now that we have it, it gives us leverage against Donald. Weâ€™re already moving to put liens on several of his properties.â€ According to Bloomberg spokesperson Daft Houser, the former New York City may use this noose over Trumpâ€™s head to force his organization into distracting negotiations. â€œAs Mike said, the liens are going in this week. And the Trump organization has already reached out to us. Mostly with lawsuit threats,â€ said Mr. Houser speaking from the Miami, Florida campaign headquarters. â€œNobody has been able to reveal the criminal nature of Trumpâ€™s emoluments violations in such a quick and effective manner. Theyâ€™re scared.â€ Critics say President Trump continues to violate the Constitution by retaining ownership and control of his sprawling business empire. They say this went against both long-standing historical practice and the advice of career government ethics officials and put him at odds with the Constitutionâ€™s original anti-corruption provisions the moment he was sworn in. The White House acknowledged that â€œan interest outside of Trump Enterprises has purchased negative equity financial products contained within the companyâ€™s portfolio,â€ but declined to say who it was, nor what impact that will have on the operations of the Presidentâ€™s properties. However, in what has become a habit by Eric Trump, the youngest Trump clumsily took to Twitter to express his frustration. â€œBloombergâ€™s shekels canâ€™t buy the Presidency from my Father, who only cares about America #KAG2020.â€ The Tweet has been since deleted. The Trump 2020 campaign has not responded to Bloombergâ€™s debt purchase but said Eric has been put on a â€œTwitter timeout.â€","[""bloomberg"",""trump"",""mr. bloomberg"",""new york c"",""austin"",""donald"",""donald trump"",""trumps debt"",""constitut"",""dollar"",""presid"",""debt"",""lien"",""new york"",""america"",""florida"",""miami"",""texa"",""mike bloomberg"",""james badwat"",""eric trump"",""daft hous"",""houser"",""eric"",""mike"",""james badwater institute of public policy and veterinary eth"",""the university of chicago"",""trump enterpris"",""deutsche bank"",""white hous"",]","[""bloomberg"",""trump"",""mr. bloomberg"",""new york city"",""austin"",""trumps debt"",""liens"",""debt"",""new york"",""america"",""donalds"",""florida"",""texas"",""miami"",""james badwater"",""mike bloomberg"",""donald trumps"",""donald trump"",""daft houser"",""eric trump"",""donald"",""houser"",""eric"",""mike"",""james badwater institute of public policy and veterinary ethics"",""the university of chicagos"",""trump enterprises"",""deutsche bank"",""white house"",""2020"",]"
California Legislature Cancels Presidentâ€™s Day: â€˜We Wonâ€™t Celebrate Trumpâ€™,https://tatersgonnatate.com/california-legislature-cancels-presidents-day-we-wont-celebrate-trump/,"In an emergency session held illegally on a Sunday, which also happens to be Leonid Stalinâ€™s birthday, the California legislature has voted to cancel Presidentâ€™s Day â€œuntil such time as respect has been restored to the White House.â€ Governor Galvin Newscomb signed the bill into law over lunch at Wahooâ€™s Fish Taco, where he was meeting with leaders from Mexico about opening more of the border to illegal immigrants. According to a press release from Newsconbâ€™s office, the bill wasnâ€™t very difficult to pass: â€œToday, the California legislature passed the first cancelation of a federal holiday in our nationâ€™s history. After an overwhelming response from a public petition signed by more than 30 million Californians, the elected representatives of our state decided that there was no way we could hols any form of celebration of the Office of the President of the United States while a criminal occupies it. â€œThe canceled holiday does not mean children would have to go to school or that state offices will be open. We will instead celebrate â€˜Immigration Day,â€™ and offer all of the stateâ€™s undocumented workers a free meal and medical checkup with no questions asked.â€ The stunt is said to have a cost of nearly $6 billion, which is enough money to fund education in Mississippi for the next 400 years, but they just donâ€™t care. This is what happens when you let communists run a state. They destroy it. More than a million Trump supporters and a guy who really likes Mike Pence are planning demonstrations at their local In N Out Burger. The chain has announced that red MAGA hats and misspelled signs wonâ€™t be welcome inside, but that people are welcome to make spectacles of themselves outside all they like.

State Farm Cancels Bloombergâ€™s Life Insurance After Hillary VP Announcement,https://prntly.com/2020/02/16/state-farm-cancels-bloombergs-life-insurance-after-hillary-vp-announcement/,"Michael Bloomberg stood tall this morning on a stack of books, telling his supporters and the media that he has decided upon his VP: Hillary Clinton. Unfortunately for the tiny mayor, his decision just cost him in a way he never expected. State Farm called him up after actuaries calculated and crunched the numbers: he was no longer insurable. They cited the fact that Hillary was intent on becoming the President â€œby hook or by crookâ€ and that the billionaireâ€™s life could possibly be at risk. Bloomberg has two daughters, Georgina and Emma, who would be the beneficiaries of the policy in the unfortunate case where he would pass away. The pint sized billionaire is worth $62 billion and his policies are said to be worth 5x the amount of his net worth as suggested by top financial planners. â€œMichael Bloomberg was a great customerâ€, said a State Farm rep, â€œhe always paid his premiums on time, and has been with us since 1982. But after he made a risky life decision, weâ€™ve decided that he is no longer qualified to be a policy holder.â€ Note: this article is satire.

BLOOMBERG ENRAGES TRUMP BY BUYING GREENLAND,https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/bloomberg-enrages-trump-by-buying-greenland,"NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)â€”In an apparently successful attempt to get under the skin of Donald Trump, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has purchased Greenland from Denmark. In an official statement released on Tuesday, the Prime Minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, would not disclose the price that Bloomberg paid for Greenland but indicated that it was an â€œall-cash offer.â€ â€œMr. Bloomberg has a lot of money,â€ Frederiksen added. News of Bloombergâ€™s purchase of Greenland reportedly infuriated Trump, who immediately ordered his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to make an offer to buy the Faroe Islands from Denmark. Within minutes, however, Denmark rebuffed Kushnerâ€™s bid. â€œWe do not believe Donald Trump is capable of running the Faroe Islands,â€ Frederiksen said.

Bakker: God Will Create a Holy Line of Trumps,https://thebiznews.org/2020/02/12/bakker-god-will-create-a-holy-line-of-trumps/,"By Piper Blackmun Former televangelist Jim Bakker has given details of a recent vision he had about the Trumps. According to Bakker, God showed him a vision of an unending line of Trumps in the White House. â€œI was sleeping last night and God came to me and showed me a vision of the White House and there were pictures of presidents on the walls,â€ said Bakker in an interview in Charisma magazine. â€œI saw pictures of Don Jr., Ivanka, Eric, Barron and even some Trumps that are not even born.â€ â€œI believe God was showing me the holy Trump line will go on because they are doing His work,â€ said Bakker. This might sound like the rantings of an insane religious zealot, but just after he was acquitted of impeachment Trump posted a video of him serving well into the 22nd century. Bakker recently promoted a concoction that could cure the coronavirus in 12 hours. â€œWell letâ€™s say it hasnâ€™t been tested on this strain of the coronavirus but itâ€™s been tested on other strains of the coronavirus and has been able to eliminate it within 12 hours â€” totally eliminates it, it kills it,â€ said naturopath Sherrill Sellman, who was a guest on Bakkerâ€™s TV show. â€œDeactivates it. And then it boosts your immune system so you can support the recovery, because when you kill the virus, then the immune system comes into action to clear it out. So you want a vibrant immune system as well as an ability to deactivate the viruses.â€ However, Trumpâ€™s idiot son, Don Jr., is currently being groomed to replace him, even though he has zero political experience. Trump Jr. recently appeared on the propaganda show â€œFOX and Friendsâ€ and received a fawning welcome. â€œWe just got a chance to witness, possibly, the 46th president of the United States,â€ said co-host/dimwit Brian Kilmeade. Don Jr. and his sister â€œPrincessâ€ Ivanka are currently ranked no. 2 and 4 in the GOP presidential race for 2024.","[""bakker"",""trump"",""don jr."",""immune system"",""coronaviru"",""god"",""ivanka"",""white hous"",""vision"",""pictur"",""hour"",""united st"",""sherrill sellman"",""brian kilmead"",""jim bakk"",""eric"",""piper blackmun form"",""gop"",""fox"",""22nd centuri"",""2024"",""piper blackmun former televangelist jim bakk"",""co-host/dimwit brian kilmead"",""naturopath sherrill sellman"",""sister princess ivanka"",""propaganda show fox"",""impeachment trump"",""religious zealot"",""charisma magazin"",""political experi"",]","[""bakker"",""trumps"",""don jr."",""immune system"",""coronavirus"",""god"",""ivanka"",""white house"",""pictures"",""vision"",""hours"",""united states"",""sherrill sellman"",""brian kilmeade"",""jim bakker"",""trump"",""eric"",""piper blackmun former"",""gop"",""fox"",""22nd century"",""2024"",""piper blackmun former televangelist jim bakker"",""co-host/dimwit brian kilmeade"",""naturopath sherrill sellman"",""sister princess ivanka"",""political experience"",""propaganda show fox"",""charisma magazine"",""impeachment trump"",]"
United States Led Entire World In Reducing CO2 Emissions In 2019,https://www.dailywire.com/news/united-states-led-entire-world-in-reducing-co2-emissions-in-2019,"The United States led the entire world in reducing CO2 emissions last year while also experiencing solid economic growth, according to a newly released report. â€œThe United States saw the largest decline in energy-related CO 2 emissions in 2019 on a country basis â€“ a fall of 140 Mt, or 2.9%, to 4.8 Gt,â€ The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported on Tuesday. â€œUS emissions are now down almost 1 Gt from their peak in the year 2000, the largest absolute decline by any country over that period.â€ â€œA 15% reduction in the use of coal for power generation underpinned the decline in overall US emissions in 2019,â€ the IEA continued. â€œCoal-fired power plants faced even stronger competition from natural gas-fired generation, with benchmark gas prices an average of 45% lower than 2018 levels. As a result, gas increased its share in electricity generation to a record high of 37%. Overall electricity demand declined because demand for air-conditioning and heating was lower as a result of milder summer and winter weather. The IEA noted that 80% of the increase in CO2 emissions came from Asia and that China and India both contributed significantly to the increase. â€œIn China, emissions rose but were tempered by slower economic growth and higher output from low-carbon sources of electricity,â€ the IEA reported. â€œRenewables continued to expand in China, and 2019 was also the first full year of operation for seven large-scale nuclear reactors in the country.â€ â€œEmissions growth in India was moderate in 2019, with CO 2 emissions from the power sector declining slightly as electricity demand was broadly stable and strong renewables growth prompted coal-fired electricity generation to fall for the first time since 1973,â€ the IEA concluded. â€œContinued growth in fossil-fuel demand in other sectors of the Indian economy, notably transport, offset the decline in the power sector. Emissions grew strongly in Southeast Asia, lifted by robust coal demand.â€ Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) responded to the news by writing on Twitter, â€œFACT you will NEVER see on the 6 oâ€™clock news: U.S. emissions FELL 2.9%, or by 140 million tons, continuing the trend of the United States LEADING THE WORLD IN TOTAL EMISSIONS DECLINE since 2000.â€ The news came after the media promoted far-left climate extremists like socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Greta Thunberg who demonized the U.S. and economic growth for polluting the world. Thunberg attacked the U.S. last month during a speech she gave at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland for leaving the Paris Climate Accord, despite the fact that the U.S. leads the world in reducing CO2 emissions. â€œThe fact that the U.S.A. is leaving the Paris accord seems to outrage and worry everyone, and it should,â€ Thunberg said. â€œBut the fact that weâ€™re all about to fail the commitments you signed up for in the Paris Agreement doesnâ€™t seem to bother the people in power even the least.â€","[""iea"",""%"",""u. s."",""2019"",""emiss"",""fact"",""united st"",""china"",""economic growth"",""co2 emiss"",""world"",""india"",""pari"",""thunberg"",""2000"",""power sector"",""increas"",""countri"",""declin"",""result"",""year"",""new"",""gt"",""9%"",""southeast asia"",""switzerland"",""davo"",""asia"",""us"",""alexandria ocasio-cortez"",]","[""iea"",""%"",""u. s."",""2019"",""emissions"",""fact"",""united states"",""china"",""economic growth"",""co2 emissions"",""world"",""india"",""paris"",""thunberg"",""2000"",""power sector"",""increase"",""decline"",""country"",""result"",""year"",""news"",""gt"",""9%"",""southeast asia"",""switzerland"",""davos"",""asia"",""us"",""alexandria ocasio-cortez"",]"
The UFO Spotlight Onâ€¦,https://ufospotlight.wordpress.com/2020/02/13/chinese-intelligence-officer-reveals-true-magnitude-of-chinas-coronavirus-crisis/,"Sure, they did build something in six days. But it was not a â€œhospital. â€ The true nature of the building was considered â€œtop secret.â€ Initially, I was naive enough to believe that the Party was demonstrating its compassion and care for the people. But then my superiors sent me to Huoshenshan. I was shown around the installation by a military police officer called Corporal Meng (this is not his real name). It was there that I saw the truth. As I have mentioned, the only way to protect oneself from the Agent is by wearing a special protective mask that is entirely unlike those available commercially. Even medical professionals do not have access to it. It is available only to biomedical warfare researchers and it contains extremely advanced technology. These masks need to be kept at a particular temperature to offer full protection, and lose their effectiveness very quickly. As I have also already said, one of the benefits of my position was that both my family and I had access to regular supplies, which is why were safe when compared to civilians, doctors and even lower-level government officials, all of whom wore utterly ineffective surgical masks in the misguided belief that they would protect them. And so, wearing this special equipment, I went to Huoshenshan with Corporal Meng. Whatever you want to call that place, it is not a hospital. Sure, the entrance looks like a hospital and in the ward at the front of the complex, there are what appear to be normal medical beds. There, thousands of infected patients lie, all of them in the early stages of the disease. I walked along those long, white corridors next to Corporal Meng, his angular face dispassionate in his military fatigues, and saw hundreds upon hundreds of identical hospital beds on which squirmed the terrified and diseased inhabitants of Wuhan. Their cries and pleas haunt me in the long nights in which I now am unable to sleep. But this was merely the beginning. Eventually the Corporal took me to the rear of this front section. There, locked metal gates led to what he called the â€œmiddle sectionâ€. The patients in the front are unaware of its existence. It is there that the more advanced cases are kept, in what most closely resembles a mental asylum. Immediately upon entering this part of Huoshenshan, I was struck by the dim lighting and stench of vomit and human waste. Here the unfortunates roamed freely, their minds gradually disintegrating in endless panic attacks and psychotic episodes. Here too there were no more doctors, merely gorilla-faced men in black uniforms who belonged to some secret branch of the military police I had never heard of. They appeared to have been selected for their cruelty, for they beat and degraded the patients in the most sadistic manner. Many of the inmates had regressed to childlike states and lay on the floor weeping like infants and begging for compassion that they did not receive. There was cruel pleasure in the eyes of these thugs as they brutalised the unfortunates. They beat them with batons, sprayed pepper spray into their eyes and kicked them with their steel-capped boots. As I was from military intelligence, the guards did not even attempt to hide their activities. They even invited me to join; in every way, they treated me as one of them. Yes, one of them. I stood in the grey staff bathroom of Huoshenshan and looked into a cheap mirror and asked myself â€” is this really what you are? Are you really like them? But the violence was not merely an expression of sadism, for the poor inmates were not there to be cared for. They were there to work. There was one more set of doors, and beyond them lay what the Corporal called the â€œCore.â€ And it was there that I saw it â€” piles and piles of dead bodies, stacked on top of one another all the way to the ceiling. There were men, women and children, elderlies and toddlers, rich and poor, beautiful and misshapen, proud and humble. They were all of them dead. Our Agent made no distinction between any of them. I gasped when the Corporal led me to the Core. I cannot count how many there were, but it was many, many thousands. And in the midst of the piles of corpses was a kind of path, and I heard a roaring sound in the distance. The miserable patients from the middle section picked up the dead and carried and dragged them away into the dark, even as the guards beat them with truncheons. It took me a little while before I grasped what was happening. I simply could not believe what lay at the end of that path in the Core. It was an enormous furnace, with great fires roaring within. One by one, their minds destroyed and their bodies twisted, the dying men and women carried the corpses to the furnace and cast them inside in a doomed attempt to hide the dreadful truth. I saw several of them collapse from exhaustion only for their lifeless bodies to be added to the mountains of corpses on both sides. In a seemingly endless line they went, their emaciated bodies clad in grey overalls, their backs bent under the weight of their dreadful cargo. Many howled and groaned in terror and their voices joined in a sorrowful cacophony that lingered over the roar of the fires. In deep shock, I stared at the boundless horror before me. Beside me stood Corporal Meng, his freshly-shaved face as emotionless as before. When I turned to face him, he looked at me. His mouth smiled, but his eyes did not. â€œWe use the energy to operate Huoshenshan,â€ he said. â€œWe save the state considerable resources in this way. And look,â€ â€” he waved at the gallery of the dead â€” â€œthere are so many of them here. You could almost describe it as renewable energy.â€ He laughed and waved his hand in a strangely camp gesture. I stood speechless and stared at the infernal scenes before me. Men in black uniforms screamed like daemons at the wretches who were disposing of the corpses for them. They stripped the dead of anything that had value â€” jewellery, cash, expensive clothing â€” and tossed these items onto an enormous pile next to the furnace. When I asked the Corporal what would be done with the items, they said that they would be used to pay for the â€œhealthcare expensesâ€ incurred by the patientsâ€™ stay in Huoshenshan. I vomited in the toilet. When I flushed and came out of the stall, Corporal Meng stood by the door and looked at me. His face was as blank as before, but in his eyes I thought I registered a very faint trace of contempt. You are ten years my senior, the look said, but you are soft. I thanked him for his service and went home. When I arrived, I saw that I had received hundreds of updates on the encrypted device the Party uses to communicate to insiders. The news were unimaginably grim. The State Legal and Economic Commission had allocated funds for the construction of dozens of facilities like Huoshenshan all throughout China. The Agent had spread not only to every single province of the motherland, but to most other nations in the world. Fortunately, we had agreements in place with other governments â€” they agreed to pretend that the infections were due to a coronavirus. They were just as worried as we were that a panic might break out in their countries. The Americans, in particular, were terrified that the S&P 500 might decline. This, they said, would be unacceptable in an election year, so we could count on their full support. Of course the World Health Organisation also helped us. For a long time, the only issue with the WHO has been that we have been locked in a contest with the Americans about who bribes them more. They released all sorts of sophisticated misinformation about having decoded the DNA of the so-called coronavirus. All this has allowed us to stave off a global panic. For now. Yet the situation was worsening with astonishing speed. I am reluctant to reveal too much on this point, as it would make it too easy for my enemies to identify me, but we quickly began to implement measures to protect our most senior leaders. If you look at the world news, you will see that Xi Jinping, our President, disappeared for approximately one week after the outbreak, before being seen again with the leader of Cambodia. You should know that the person who met the Cambodian leader was not President Xi. It was a body double who had, for many years, been trained to look and sound just like our President. President Xi is of course not careless enough to risk his own death. He is safely ensconced in a secret bunker underneath Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of the Party in Beijing. Nor was he the only leader who is in hiding. In fact, I can assure you that over half of all senior Party members are currently being imitated by trained actors who are following instructions given to them via special implants. Do you really think that our Prime Minister would risk his life by going to Wuhan? All of this means that our government has become utterly paralysed and the functions of the state have been taken over by the military. It became clear to me that our efforts were pointless. Yes, the lockdowns, travel bans and targeted assassinations of rebellious journalists allowed us to hide the true situation in Wuhan; but I knew that this would not last. Once the mass deaths begin in the rest of the world â€” in our estimation, this should happen within the next week or so â€” everyone will know the truth. It will become clear that we cannot protect ourselves from the Agent. Surgical masks, hand sanitiser, gloves â€” nothing can stop it. Nothing except the special hazmat masks, but those cannot be produced in anything like sufficient quantities. You, an ordinary person, will never even receive one, let alone a sufficient number to see you through the coming holocaust. For those of you reading this, therefore, all I can suggest is that you keep your loved ones close to you. Hug them, tell them what they mean to you. Enjoy the time you have left with them. It is not typical in Chinese culture to express oneâ€™s feelings in this way, but I have learnt the importance of such gestures. I promised my wife that I would show this document to her before I posted it. Yet I broke my word. I hear her weep in loud, hoarse sobs in the bedroom, and the keyboard of my laptop is wet with my own tears. Not long ago, we received results of the regular tests that are part of our â€œpriority medical treatmentâ€, and we learnt that my son had been infected with the Agent. The military police that has supplied me with the special protective mask had been giving expired and ineffective masks to my son, masks that senior officials had already worn and then discarded when they ceased to protect them. My own masks, on the other hand, had always been of the necessary quality. I suppose they decided that my son was of lower priority than me. I suppose my son could not help them with their cover-up. We had long ago decided that we would be different â€” we would be honest with him, always. And so when he asked us, we told him the truth. We told him that he was very sick. He asked more, and we told him he would not get better. He continued asking, and we told him that he would die. He is very small, but he was old enough to understand. His terrified wails will haunt me for the rest of my miserable days in this world. Let them come. Let them do with me as they will. I no longer care.","[""huoshenshan"",""corporal meng"",""agent"",""corpor"",""corps"",""wai"",""son"",""ey"",""wuhan"",""parti"",""patient"",""hospit"",""hundr"",""truth"",""world"",""pile"",""core"",""men"",""protective mask"",""military polic"",""surgical mask"",""black uniform"",""president xi"",""middle sect"",""american"",""unfortun"",""compass"",""furnac"",""access"",""presid"",]","[""huoshenshan"",""corporal meng"",""agent"",""corporal"",""corpses"",""eyes"",""way"",""son"",""wuhan"",""party"",""hundreds"",""patients"",""hospital"",""truth"",""world"",""piles"",""core"",""men"",""protective mask"",""military police"",""middle section"",""black uniforms"",""surgical masks"",""president xi"",""unfortunates"",""compassion"",""americans"",""president"",""anything"",""doctors"",]"

Montana Man Arrested After His Best Selling Jerky Is Found To Be Made Of Human Meat,https://ringsssss.com/uncategorized/montana-man-arrested-after-his-best-selling-jerky-is-found-to-be-made-of-human-meat-2/,"Butte, MT â€“ 72 year old Shep Arnold has been arrested for selling dehydrated human meat A.K.A. jerky at his general store â€œShepâ€™s Goodsâ€. Well not all â€œShepâ€™s Goodsâ€ are â€œGoodâ€. Arnold has been running his store for the last 35 years and over time there became a cult following for his distinctive jerky. Most everyone who had the opportunity to visit Butte, would get a some of Shepâ€™s jerky. It just so happened that an executive from Jack Links was staying in Butte for a family event. He decided to purchase so of Shepâ€™s jerky and take it back to work and see if anyone there could see what it is that made Shepâ€™s jerky so special. When the jerky made its way back to the Jack Links factory, it was given to the in house scientists to run tests on in hopes of deciphering what ingredients Arnold was using for his jerky. What they didnâ€™t expect was that the meat wasnâ€™t that of a cow, but of a HUMAN! Tests were ran by an independent lab to verify the results by Jack Links. Again Human meat. Local authorities arrested Arnold on suspicion of using human meat for his jerky that he sold to the public and police needed to find the supply of this meat. Skipper, the K-9, was really all in on this investigation providing important leads and clues with his sniffer. Authorities were stunned as many of them had enjoyed Shepâ€™s Jerky. Turns out about once a year in the summer, Shep hires a new helper for his store. â€œSummer is a busy time and I can use the extra help for a few monthsâ€, said Arnold. What he neglected to say, but was later found out by authorities, that 3 of these men have been reported missing. It doesnâ€™t take much for the Butte authorities to put 2 and 2 together and place Shep Arnold under arrest for making and selling the human meat. While locked up authorities hope to connect the missing men via DNA extracted from the jerky to known samples of the missing men. As more is revealed, we will update this story.","[""sheps jerki"",""jerki"",""jack link"",""arnold"",""shep"",""human meat"",""author"",""year"",""butt"",""men"",""shep arnold"",""sheps good"",""summer"",""store"",""test"",""a. k. a."",""last 35 year"",""human meat a. k. a. jerki"",""general store sheps good"",""jack links factori"",""ingredients arnold"",""distinctive jerki"",""place shep arnold"",""independent lab"",""house scientist"",""important lead"",""local author"",""butte author"",""most everyon"",""extra help"",]","[""sheps jerky"",""jerky"",""jack links"",""arnold"",""authorities"",""human meat"",""butte"",""men"",""shep arnold"",""sheps"",""sheps goods"",""summer"",""tests"",""store"",""year"",""a. k. a."",""shep"",""last 35 years"",""general store sheps goods"",""human meat a. k. a. jerky"",""jack links factory"",""ingredients arnold"",""butte authorities"",""local authorities"",""distinctive jerky"",""place shep arnold"",""house scientists"",""independent lab"",""important leads"",""most everyone"",]"
Goodwill Executives Arrested After Years Of Skimming Donated Goods Off Top,https://www.theonion.com/goodwill-executives-arrested-after-years-of-skimming-do-1819578191,"Goodwill executives are led from the companyâ€™s headquarters, where authorities reportedly found file cabinets filled with hundreds of Super Nintendo cartridges and needlepoint Christmas stockings. ROCKVILLE, MDâ€”In what authorities are calling one of the most wide-reaching and deplorable cases of embezzlement in recent history, seven executives at Goodwill Industries International were arrested Thursday for allegedly skimming used clothing, old furniture, small appliances, and thousands of other donated items from the charitable group. â€œWeâ€™re looking at some very serious abuses at the highest levels of Goodwillâ€™s corporate hierarchy,â€ said FBI lead investigator Samuel Corson, addressing reporters as he stood next to a table piled high with dozens of CRT computer monitors and Rainbow Brite lunchboxes confiscated in recent federal raids. â€œVelcro orthopedic shoes, mini trampolines, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass LPsâ€”these individuals were defrauding their own organization of thousands upon thousands of previously owned and slightly damaged items.â€ Advertisement Some of the evidence recovered from the Goodwill executivesâ€™ residences. â€œFrom the number of Sunbeam-brand blenders and porcelain cherubs weâ€™ve seized so far, we estimate this misappropriation of goods has been going on for more than a decade,â€ he added. Corson said the FBI was first alerted to the situation early last year, when an anonymous whistleblower inside the nonprofit organization tipped off agents to an ongoing scheme in which garbage bags full of elastic-waisted jeans and old Cub Scout uniforms would be accepted from legitimate donors and then immediately diverted to an undisclosed private warehouse, never making it to the shelves at Goodwillâ€™s retail locations. Authorities confirmed that in order to build their case against the groupâ€™s leadership, they monitored suspects around the clock, often taking thousands of surveillance photos of high-ranking employees as they left Goodwill locations with armloads of souvenir ashtrays and novelty shot glasses. Many executives were also reportedly spotted in public using promotional umbrellas from auto insurance companies or bowling balls engraved with other peopleâ€™s names. Advertisement â€œThese guys cooked the books so no one would know they had their hand in the donation bin,â€ said Christopher Chen, a forensic accountant with the FBI. â€œFor example, if someone left 10 VHS tapes in the drop-off box, they would only mark nine of those as received. Suddenly, you have a Jane Fonda workout video that doesnâ€™t exist on paper, and one of these crooked Goodwill execs is taking it home. They skimmed 10 percent off the top like that all the time.â€ â€œIt began with a used wheelchair here and a Danielle Steel paperback there, but pretty soon they started to think they were untouchable,â€ he continued. â€œA box of old pocket calculators would â€˜fall off a truck,â€™ and they couldnâ€™t stop themselves. They kept wanting more.â€ Advertisement After executing search warrants in the suspectsâ€™ homes and rented storage units, law enforcement agents said they carted away a sizable number of AM/FM radios and golf visors advertising Pepsi products, as well as hundreds of malfunctioning Big Mouth Billy Bass toys. Legal experts have estimated that, if convicted, the executives could be forced to pay up to $450 in restitutions. Advertisement â€œI got suspicious when I noticed some costume jewelry missing from the store and that very same night saw [Goodwill CFO] Dennis Sheplerâ€™s wife at a restaurant flaunting a pair of familiar-looking clip-on earrings and a Hard Rock CafÃ© denim jacket,â€ said a cashier at a Bethesda, MD Goodwill location, who wished not to be identified. â€œThen our store manager whoâ€™s been to their house told me their kitchen has more drip coffeemakers with missing carafes than sheâ€™s ever seen in her life. Something about that just didnâ€™t add up.â€ Defense attorney Gary McMullin, who represents several of the accused executives, proclaimed their innocence as he spoke to reporters in his office, inviting them to sit down in a variety of worn, mismatched chairs. Advertisement â€œGoodwill is a compassionate organization that provides so much to those in need, and my clients have given years of dedicated, selfless service to this company,â€ McMullin said as he stood near a bookcase containing five nonconsecutive volumes of the World Book Encyclopedia and adjusted the â€œHome of the Whopperâ€ belt buckle holding up his flared, stained tuxedo pants. â€œThese allegations are completely outrageous, and we absolutely intend to fight them.","[""thousand"",""fbi"",""advertis"",""author"",""execut"",""goodwil"",""report"",""hundr"",""item"",""home"",""bethesda"",""rockvil"",""tijuana"",""christopher chen"",""samuel corson"",""gary mcmullin"",""dennis shepl"",""herb alpert"",""jane fonda"",""mcmullin"",""corson"",""goodwill industries intern"",""big mouth billy bass"",""super nintendo"",""danielle steel"",""rainbow brit"",""rock caf"",""pepsi"",""crt"",""thursdai"",]","[""thousands"",""fbi"",""advertisement"",""authorities"",""executives"",""goodwills"",""reporters"",""hundreds"",""items"",""home"",""rockville"",""bethesda"",""tijuana"",""christopher chen"",""dennis sheplers"",""samuel corson"",""gary mcmullin"",""herb alpert"",""jane fonda"",""mcmullin"",""corson"",""goodwill industries international"",""big mouth billy bass"",""super nintendo"",""danielle steel"",""rainbow brite"",""rock caf"",""pepsi"",""crt"",""thursday"",]"
Mike Pence introduces program to cure coronavirus carriers with conversion therapy,https://www.thebeaverton.com/2020/02/mike-pence-introduces-program-to-cure-coronavirus-carriers-with-conversion-therapy/,"WASHINGTON D.C. â€“ In his first hours leading the U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mike Pence announced a bold program of conversion therapy to convince infected Americans they donâ€™t have the disease after all. Drawing on the techniques he believes turn gay people straight, Pence claimed â€œNo-one is born with coronavirus, so the key is making them hate everything about themselves. Then and only then will they reject their unhealthy attachment to this so-called respiratory virus.â€ â€œGod made Adam & Eve, not Adam & Covid-19,â€ he added. Despite widespread criticism, the Vice President insisted that the science he chooses to believe clearly demonstrates that this is the best solution. Planned techniques include dangling a picture of a flu-free (and super hot) woman in front of the carriers while a priest chants â€˜you are not sickâ€™ over and over, pep talks from former corona carriers who call themselves â€˜ex-coronasâ€™ and of, course, quarantine. â€œQuarantine is the best,â€ Pence declared, â€œIâ€™ve been quarantining myself from women for decades and my marriage couldnâ€™t be more infection-free.â€","[""penc"",""quarantin"",""adam"",""washington"",""mike p"",""u. s."",""adam & ev"",""d. c"",""former corona carri"",""conversion therapi"",""infected american"",""widespread critic"",""planned techniqu"",""marriage couldnt"",""respiratory viru"",""unhealthy attach"",""washington d. c"",""covid-19 pandem"",""u. s. respons"",""priest chant"",""bold program"",""vice presid"",""best solut"",""first hour"",""coronaviru"",""techniqu"",""pep talk"",""covid-19"",""carrier"",""everyth"",]","[""pence"",""quarantine"",""adam"",""washington"",""mike pence"",""u. s."",""adam & eve"",""d. c"",""former corona carriers"",""widespread criticism"",""unhealthy attachment"",""infected americans"",""conversion therapy"",""planned techniques"",""respiratory virus"",""covid-19 pandemic"",""marriage couldnt"",""washington d. c"",""u. s. response"",""vice president"",""best solution"",""priest chants"",""bold program"",""first hours"",""coronavirus"",""everything"",""techniques"",""pep talks"",""covid-19"",""carriers"",]"
